# Cycling Apps with ZWO/FIT Import

Domestique v4.0.0-alpha is a planner + workout library + post-ride viewer.
You ride with one of the apps below, then import the FIT file back into
Domestique for analysis.

This table compares the free (or formerly free) cycling apps that accept
`.zwo` workout files and/or drive a Tacx Neo 2T smart trainer.

## RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR USE CASE

1. **MyWhoosh** — only mainstream app that is genuinely free forever, supports .zwo upload via its web builder, drives the Neo 2T in full ERG, and works on every platform. Zero paywall for a user who wants to do structured rides.
2. **Golden Cheetah** — free, open-source, installs locally, accepts ZWO/ERG/MRC and drives Tacx Neo 2T in ERG over ANT+ FE-C. Ugly UI and no scenery, but zero vendor lock-in and perfect for a pure-training workflow; great backup/analysis tool alongside MyWhoosh.
