## How the planner thinks (logic + science)

This deeper section explains *why* every threshold has the value it does, with inline citations to the literature.

### 0a. Honest limitations of the TSS-based stack

The peer-reviewed evidence supporting TSS as a *quantifier of training that was done* is reasonable. The evidence supporting it as a *predictor of training that will work* is correlational, mixed, and rarely tested out-of-sample.

| Study | n | finding |
|---|---|---|
| [Sanders et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28095061/) | road cyclists, season-long | TSS correlated **r ~ 0.75–0.79** with sub-maximal lactate-threshold power changes |
| [Wallace et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662229/) | runners | TSS vs. 1500 m time **r ~ 0.70**, slightly better than TRIMP (r ~ 0.65) and session-RPE (r ~ 0.60) |
| [Vermeire et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31498226/) | 11 recreational cyclists, 12 weeks | **inconsistent** associations between TSS, multiple TRIMP variants, and 3 km TT performance. Different training types produce different adaptations despite identical TSS — "the relationship to performance will always be distorted." |

**Where TSS works:** as a workout descriptor for steady-state efforts; as a cumulative dose tracker when training is homogeneous; as a rough heuristic for taper/race timing.

**Where TSS breaks:** when training is intensity-heterogeneous (interval-heavy != endurance-heavy at same TSS); when efforts are above FTP and duration matters (the minute-2 vs minute-19 problem); when one event-specific energy system dominates; when workouts are highly intermittent (the NP recipe was designed for steady road riding, not 30/30 intervals).

**How Domestique mitigates** without replacing TSS as the primary load currency: the seven injury-prevention guardrails (G1–G7) layered on top of TSS-driven planning capture several of the failure modes Vermeire flags — see [§0b](#0b-literature-wired-into-the-planner) below.

**One failure mode no load metric can cover.** All of the above measures the dose delivered. None of it measures the athlete's *response* to that dose, and the response is where overreaching announces itself first. In the one cyclist study that tested this directly ([Ten Haaf et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27834554/), n=30), accumulated session-RPE load did **not** discriminate functional overreaching — but two subjective items, pre-session fatigue and readiness-to-train, classified it correctly in 78% of riders at three days (sens 79%, spec 77%). Perceived-effort measures also decouple from power and heart rate far more sharply in overreached riders (d = 0.79–1.79) than objective ratios do on their own (d = 0.03–0.41; [Sanders et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29016241/)). That is the specific gap [§0f](#0f-subjective-load-what-rpe-and-wellness-ratings-can-and-cannot-do) covers, and the reason both items are collected.

These guardrails layered on top of TSS-driven planning are what makes Domestique more than a TSS-EWMA dashboard. They directly address several of the failure modes Vermeire 2021 flags, while keeping TSS as the central currency the rider sees.

### 0c. Norwegian Method support — what's in, what's missing

The Norwegian Method (Marius Bakken / Ingebrigtsen / Bjorgen) explicitly **rejects TSS** as the primary intensity controller and substitutes blood lactate. Domestique covers parts of it but not the lactate-pacing core.

**Explicit non-goal:** Domestique does **not** capture or prescribe blood lactate during training. Finger-prick / earlobe-prick blood sampling adds friction we don't want — riders shouldn't have to draw blood mid-ride to use the planner. So we don't ship lactate input fields, lactate-prescribed sessions, or MLSS test protocols. Instead, we approximate the same physiology using signals already captured non-invasively from the FIT file (HR + RR-intervals -> DFA alpha1 + autonomic load) and from the power trace (Skiba W'-balance + post-ride decoupling).

| Norwegian Method element | What it controls intensity by | Domestique substitute |
|---|---|---|
| Lactate-controlled threshold work | Blood lactate 2-4 mmol/L during the session | **Power-based threshold class** (95-105 % FTP) + **HR ceiling** at ~88 % HR_max -> flags G6 if exceeded for >15 min in a sub-threshold session. |
| Double-threshold sessions (AM + PM) | Two sub-LT2 sessions same day | Partially — threshold-class workouts exist; v1.1.0 adds explicit AM/PM scheduling **without lactate gating**. |
| HR as primary intensity proxy when lactate isn't available | HR ceiling that approximates LT2 | HR ingested from FIT; v1.1.0 wires HR-ceiling into session prescription. |
| MLSS testing protocol | Distinct test from FTP, requires blood draws | **Out of scope.** FTP + Coggan-20 + Ramp tests only. |
| Conservative volume ramp (no big TSS spikes) | Total volume in hours | Tracked + Gabbett ACWR (G4) caps weekly TSS jumps. |
| Avoidance of the moderate/threshold "trap" (Seiler-style) | Sessions explicitly avoid Z3 (76-90 % FTP) | Stoggl/Sperlich 80/0/20 + G3 enforce this. |
| Daily readiness signal (Bakken: lactate response to a fixed warmup) | Resting lactate or sub-LT1 sample-power | **DFA alpha1 from RR-intervals** — same physiological substrate (autonomic / parasympathetic withdrawal proxy). [Rogers et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33519504/) shows DFA alpha1 tracks the LT1 boundary non-invasively from beat-to-beat HR variability. |
| In-session "back off" signal | Lactate climbing above 4 mmol/L | **W'-balance** from Skiba 2015 differential — depleting W' captures the same "above-threshold for too long" dynamic that drives lactate accumulation. Live during ride. |
| Workout-was-too-hard detection | Post-session lactate elevation | **Aerobic decoupling** post-ride from FIT (HR drift vs. power drift) + DFA alpha1 nadir during the session. |

**The honest framing**: Domestique gives you a Norwegian-Method-shaped polarization plan (80/0/20, Z3 avoidance, conservative ramp) and approximates the daily-readiness piece via DFA alpha1 (autonomic) and W'-balance (mechanical) — both come for free from the FIT file with the right sensors. We don't replicate the lactate-prescribed precision of the Norwegian elites, but we capture the *intent* (sub-LT2 controlled work + autonomic-fatigue-aware day-to-day adjustment) without asking the rider to bleed.

**What ICU computes vs. what Domestique computes:**
- **From ICU** (cached as-is): NP, IF, TSS, time-in-zone, aerobic decoupling, kJ above FTP, wPrime, pMax, eFTP, CTL/ATL/TSB defaults.
- **Locally computed by Domestique**: Treff polarization index + classification (so the result is identical even when ICU is offline), the 16-class library taxonomy match, the seven G1–G7 guardrails, eFTP cross-check from local FIT archive, capability projection (Pinot & Grappe RPP), DFA alpha1 (when RR-intervals are present in the FIT), Belastingscore (v1.0.6) for energy-system decomposition.

### 0e. Belastingscore / 3D impulse-response model (v1.0.6)

The 3-dimensional impulse-response model from [Kontro/Mastracci/Cheung/MacInnis 2026 (PLOS ONE)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0341721) ships in v1.0.6 as an **additive lens** alongside TSS — not a replacement. It splits training stress into three energy systems with their own time constants:

| component | power-curve param | what it tracks | Banister tau_1 / tau_2 (paper defaults, profile-overridable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CP** (aerobic) | Critical Power | mitochondrial / oxidative capacity | 52 d / 10 d |
| **W'** (glycolytic) | W-prime, anaerobic work capacity | lactate-tolerance / above-CP work | 5 d / 5 d |
| **Pmax** (alactic) | Peak Power | PCr / sprint capacity | 10 d / 4 d |

**Per-ride breakdown (Kontro Eq. 8–10):** for each second of the ride, power is attributed to the three systems based on proximity to MPA (Maximum Power Available, Eq. 4). The result is **Belastingscore = SS_CP + SS_W' + SS_Pmax**, calibrated so 1 h at CP ~ 100 SS (matches the Coggan TSS convention).

**Where v1.0.6 surfaces it:**
- **Ride detail panel**: a secondary "Belastingscore — energy-system breakdown" card under the existing TSS hero grid (Total / Aerobe / Glycolytisch / PCr).
- **Athlete-Metrics chart**: a collapsed `<details>` panel below the existing CTL/ATL/TSB chart with three normalised fitness curves (CP / W' / Pmax), tau defaults from the paper.
- **Plan tab phase rows**: a small subordinate stacked bar showing CP / W' / Pmax distribution under the primary `weekly_tss` headline.

**Honest caveat the paper itself states**: "no published data exist to support the energy-system specific model parameters." The tau defaults (52/10, 5/5, 10/4) are a single-athlete illustrative example from the paper's supplementary, not population-validated. Domestique exposes them as profile-level overrides and documents the caveat in the dashboard tooltip copy.

**Why TSS stays primary:** the Kontro paper is intentionally additive — its authors keep the conventional Banister/CTL framework alongside the 3D decomposition. Domestique mirrors that. The 3D model adds resolution for athletes who want to see which energy system was stressed, but the planner still picks workouts based on the existing TSS-driven taxonomy the rider is already used to.

### 0f. Subjective load: what RPE and wellness ratings can and cannot do

Session-RPE is the cheapest signal in the stack and the easiest to over-trust. What the literature supports, and where Domestique stops:

| Claim | Evidence | What Domestique does |
|---|---|---|
| Session-RPE is a valid internal-load measure | [Foster 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9662690/) — modified CR-10, the scale the whole session-RPE base is built on | Foster CR-10 (0–10) with verbal anchors on every value. The scale id is stored alongside each rating, so if the scale ever changes, old numbers can be identified rather than silently re-read — the stored id is a record, not an enforced check |
| A single rating is noisy | [Wallace et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662229/) — sRPE test-retest **CV 28.1%** | G7 uses a 3-day mean at Foster's published ≥7 threshold, so several rated sessions dilute one outlier. Honest caveat: with only ONE rated session in the window the mean *is* that rating, so a single 6→7 does cross the threshold — the dilution is real only once you rate regularly |
| RPE catches what power and HR miss in overreached riders | [Sanders et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29016241/) — RPE:power, RPE:HR and sRPE:TSS decoupling d = 0.79–1.79 vs 0.03–0.41 for objective-only ratios | Collected and displayed; it is the only channel that needs no power meter and no 40-minute steady block |
| Pre-session fatigue + readiness-to-train discriminate functional overreaching | [Ten Haaf et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27834554/), n=30 cyclists — 78% correct at 3 days | Both are collected in the morning check-in; readiness-to-train was added in v3.6.0 because it is not one of Hooper's four items |
| Poor sleep raises perceived effort at a fixed workload | [Temesi et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23760468/); Kong 2025 sleep-restriction meta-analysis, SMD 0.39 | Wellness ratings **attribute** an elevated fatigue signal rather than casting a second weighted vote for it — two readings of one cause must not be counted twice |
| Better wellness can produce *higher* RPE | [Sansone et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37259497/) — in free-intensity training, riders who felt better simply did more work | RPE never enters the readiness composite as a linear term. A naive weighted sum can invert the sign of the very thing it is trying to measure |
| No composite can *diagnose* overreaching | [Meeusen et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23247672/) (ECSS/ACSM consensus) — diagnosis requires a controlled performance test | Nothing in Domestique says "you are overreached". The ceiling on the language is *flag*, and the ceiling on the action is one tier down |
| HRV reflects overreaching | **Not supported** — [Roete et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108275/) found HRV does not reflect overreaching in endurance athletes; HRV was never measured in Ten Haaf 2017 | HRV keeps its own role (day-to-day autonomic state, against the rider's own baseline). It is not presented as an overreaching test |

**What is deliberately not built:** an RPE-derived readiness weight, and a per-band RPE-vs-power residual trend. Both were designed and then held: with one rated session in the archive there is nothing to fit, and the residual design had two faults worth re-deriving before it ships (a work-matched comparison needs enough matched sessions per intensity band, and `RPE / IF` leaves a large within-band intensity gradient that re-admits exactly the sign inversion it was meant to remove).

**Block grading: the fifth attempt, and why it is still not shipped.** The three execution axes cannot see structure — stopping after 10 of 13 reps survives TSS and time-in-zone nearly intact — so "which prescribed blocks did I do?" is worth answering. Four attempts to answer it from the SHAPE of a lap list each survived one adversarial review and failed the next. The information they lacked is WHEN each lap happened: intervals.icu returns a start offset with every lap, and it simply was not stored. It is now, on the moving clock, so a stop at the lights is not five minutes of the plan going by.

That is a real advance and it shows: the grader reads the one real lapped ride in this archive correctly (30 blocks, three sets of ten, from 61 laps), and the library harness — every interval workout ridden fifteen ways whose truth is known by construction — now grades a perfect ride correctly on 1,648 of 1,649 files, against 350 misgraded by the positional version.

It is still not honest enough to show. About 1% of constructed sessions misgrade, and an independent adversarial pass against a green test suite then produced three separate false green ticks: an abandoned over/under session certified complete off its 90% under-legs, a block ridden as two halves with a five-minute rest reported done in full, and a flat 85%-FTP ride with the head unit auto-lapping read as eighteen VO2 blocks. One structural cause is worth recording: the gate written to catch a block wrongly called unridden asks the same admissibility test that produced the veto, so a lap rejected by a veto is invisible to the gate that exists to catch it.

All of it is pinned by failing tests. The grader, the harness and the wiring stay in the tree with a single switch off, and a rider sees the execution score, which is true, and no block report. The rule that has governed this feature through five attempts is the one it keeps failing: no verdict beats a wrong one.

**Aerobic decoupling recency (v3.6.0).** The Pw:Hr advisory used to be discarded once the source ride was more than two days old. One rest day was enough to erase it — precisely when a fatigue signal is worth reading. It now stays visible to ten days carrying an explicit confidence (`fresh` ≤3 d, `aging` ≤10 d, `stale` beyond) and its age in the copy, which is the actual fix for the original bug (a days-old number reading as today's). The advisory is display-only in every path; it never reaches the plan.

**Cooldowns, and what one is actually for (v3.7.0).** A rider finished a 6×2 min VO2max session at 28 % FTP and the prescribed cooldown ramp began at **75 % FTP** — 186 W, a step *up* of 117 W onto someone already emptied. That was not one bad file: **1,647 of 3,672** trailing cooldowns in the library started at a higher power than the segment before them ended, 1,296 started at or above 70 % FTP, and 32 started at or above 85 % — two above 100 %. The generators had been emitting a fixed ramp without reference to what preceded it.

*What a cooldown reliably does.* Three things, and the list is short on purpose. It **stops the blood-pressure crash on stopping**: 15 s after ceasing exercise, mean arterial pressure fell 18 ± 2 mmHg sitting still versus **3 ± 1 mmHg** with loadless pedalling ([Carter 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10368294/)) — and loadless and motor-driven pedalling were equivalent, so the protection is the leg muscle pump and near-zero load already delivers it. It **returns heart rate sooner**. And it **clears blood lactate faster, dose-dependently**: clearance is quickest at 80–100 % of the first lactate threshold (LT1) and at 40 % of LT1 is statistically *indistinguishable from sitting still* ([Devlin 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24739289/), [Menzies 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20544484/)).

*What it does not do.* It does not reduce soreness, improve next-day performance, or prevent injury — the one RCT (421 runners, 16 weeks) was null with numerically *more* injuries in the intervention arm ([Van Hooren & Peake 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29663142/)). It does not lower core temperature: on a stationary bike an active cooldown is no faster than sitting still even after 30 minutes, because you keep producing heat. **Indoors the lever for heat is a fan, not more pedalling**, and the app does not lengthen or harden indoor cooldowns to compensate.

*The numbers, and the two-step inference behind them.* No study has ever determined clearance-optimal cooldown intensity **in cyclists relative to FTP** — the threshold-referenced work is in running and swimming, and the 1975–84 cycle-ergometer literature puts the optimum much lower (~32–35 % VO₂max). Converting: LT1 sits at roughly 0.80 × FTP in trained cyclists ([Pallarés 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27657502/), with FTP ≈ MLSS per [Borszcz 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676826/)), so 80 % of LT1 lands near **0.64 FTP**. The library targets a **0.60 FTP start, 0.45 end**, deliberately just under that centre: vagal reactivation is essentially abolished at and above the first threshold, individual LT1 scatters ±10–15 points of FTP, and the cheaper error is to be slightly too easy. Above LT1 the muscle is still net *producing* lactate, which is why a hotter cooldown is worse at the one job a cooldown reliably does.

*Duration.* **Five minutes minimum, ten after threshold or above.** Under three minutes is not a cooldown — blood lactate peaks about four minutes *after* the last effort, so it ends before the thing it exists to manage has happened. Past about 15 minutes nothing measurable remains: two independent cohorts saw zero further lactate decrease after minute 20 ([Baldari 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15322856/), [2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16446676/)), and past 30 minutes active recovery holds muscle glycogen flat while passive rest restores it. Duration scales with session **intensity**, not session length: 60 min and 120 min below VT1 both had HRV recovered within 5–10 min, while threshold work and 6×3 min above VT2 *both* delayed it to ~30 min (Seiler 2007) — so there is no basis for a longer VO2max cooldown than a threshold one.

*The rule the library now enforces*, monotone by construction: `start = min(0.60, prev_end)` and `end = min(0.45, start)`. When the rider was already easier than the end target the segment collapses to a flat easy spin rather than ramping up to meet it. No cooldown was lengthened, shortened, added or removed, so every file's total prescribed duration is unchanged.

*What was deliberately not changed.* `IntervalsT` OffPower is never touched. Clearance-optimal intensity **between** reps is counterproductive: at 80–110 % of LT power between intervals, trained cyclists produced significantly *less* time above 80/90/95 % of maximal minute power and rated the session harder, with no gain in time above 90 % VO2peak ([Fennell & Hopker 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33098020/)). The clearance argument applies to the trailing cooldown only.

*One coupling removed to make this safe.* Whole-ride zone accounting counted cooldown seconds, so easing every cooldown moved time from Z2 to Z1 and would have relabelled 41 workouts — real sessions becoming `recovery` and routing onto recovery days — with no change to their actual stimulus. The classifier now blanks the trailing cooldown before computing zones, exactly as it already ignored FreeRide. Cooldown power can no longer decide what a workout is; the sweep itself is provably classification-neutral (0 label changes across 4,285 files).

### 0g. The readiness weights are an assumption

`compute_readiness()` weights HRV 30% / TSB 20% / subjective 20% / sleep 15% / RHR 15%. **No published trial fixes those numbers.** They are a reasoned prior: HRV highest because it is the only continuously-measured autonomic channel; TSB next because the dose model is independently validated as a *descriptor*; the subjective channel equal to TSB on the strength of Ten Haaf 2017 and [Saw et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26423706/); sleep and RHR lowest because both are largely downstream of the first three.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- **Re-weighting is a preference change, not a bug fix.** Moving weight between channels changes which days read green without any new evidence arriving, so it needs the before/after shown over the rider's own history — not a plausible argument.
- **A fitted alternative exists but is not the home-page score.** A separate composite (`readiness_composite`) computes component z-scores against the rider's own 60-day rolling baseline (Plews 2018 / Buchheit 2017) and, once ≥60 days of wellness data exist, collapses the rolling correlation matrix into ridge-regression weights clipped to [0.05, 0.50]. It ships as an API and is not yet surfaced in the interface; the fixed-weight score above is what the dashboard shows.

### 1. Periodisation engine

**Phases.** Standard Base -> Build1 -> Build2 -> Peak -> Taper for event-prep goals, or Base -> Build1 -> Build2 -> Peak -> **Consolidation** for non-event goals (FTP / VO2max / hybrid / general / endurance). Sized from `target_ctl` and `target_date` (Coggan & Allen, *Training and Racing with a Power Meter* 3rd ed.).

**Why consolidation, not taper, for FTP/VO2max cycles.** A taper is event-specific — you peak fresh on race day. If you don't have a race, you don't taper into a hole; you do a 1-week reduced-load Z2-only block to let fatigue dissipate and supercompensation peak (**Mujika 2010** *Sports Med* review: 7–14 day reduced-load period after a build block). Consolidation is `~50% of peak TSS` and ships an explicit prompt at end-of-week to FTP-test before generating the next cycle — this is the moment to cleanly capture your new fitness ceiling without residual fatigue depressing the result.

**Mid-cycle FTP recalibration (proactive overload prevention).** At the build1->build2 phase boundary the planner replaces one HIT slot with a Coggan-20 or Ramp `ftp_test` session. For cycles >= 16 weeks, a second test is also placed at the build2->peak boundary. This is a direct overload prevention: if your FTP rose 8% during build1 but the planner is still using the old value, all subsequent TSS targets and zone boundaries are computed against a baseline that's 8% too low — you train *systematically* harder than the model thinks. **Allen & Coggan TR&P 3rd ed.** recommends 4–6 week re-test cadence during build phases. The v4.1.0 eFTP-drift auto-apply path is *reactive* (waits for ICU to detect 7+ days of drift); the scheduled mid-cycle test is *proactive*.

**Weekly TSS budget** per phase (`training_planner.py PHASE_TARGETS`):

| Phase | Z1+Z2 hours | Z3+Z4 min | Z5+ min | Weekly TSS | Goal types |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Base | 9.5 | 45 | 5 | 425 | all |
| Build1 / Build2 | 7.5 | 120 | 45 | 600 | all |
| Peak | 6.0 | 90 | 80 | 650 | all |
| Taper | 4.0 | 30 | 22 | 275 | event / ctl |
| **Consolidation** | 5.5 | 20 | 0 | 240 | FTP / VO2max / hybrid / general |

Synthesised from Seiler 2010, Mujika 2010, Ronnestad 2014, and Coggan/Allen for a trained age-grouper at ~10h/week. The intensity-distribution targets (`PHASE_POLARIZED_TARGETS`) come from the Seiler 2006 / Stoggl 2014 polarised model.

**CTL ramp safety.** The planner refuses to ramp CTL faster than `ramp_rate(current_ctl)` (steeper at low CTL, plateaus at high CTL). Override gate: TSB < −30 deep into a build phase pulls back the next week's `tss_target x 0.85` (Coggan/Allen overload threshold).

### 1b. Returning after a break — why the first session back keeps its intensity

**The state a short break leaves you in is neither peaked nor detrained.** After 4–7 days of complete rest a trained rider is glycogen-replete and fatigue-free, but ~5 % down on plasma volume — a loss fully incurred within the first 48 hours and flat thereafter ([Cullinane 1986](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3747802/): 10 days of cessation, PV −5.0 % by day 2, VO2max *unchanged*). VO2max holds out to 10 days; by 14 days it is −4 % with citrate synthase −25 % and time-to-exhaustion −9 %, while running economy and fibre size are untouched ([Houmard 1992](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1487339/)). The early loss is a filling-pressure problem, not a lost adaptation — restoring blood volume by infusion restores stroke volume and VO2max almost completely ([Coyle 1986](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3944049/)).

**Complete rest is the one taper variant that does not supercompensate.** [Shepley 1992](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1559951/) ran the three 7-day tapers head-to-head in the same highly trained runners: high-intensity/low-volume **+22 %** time-to-fatigue, low-intensity moderate-volume +6 % (ns), rest-only **−3 %** with citrate synthase and blood volume down. A rider at positive TSB after a week off is therefore *not* peaked — the freshness is real but the priming is gone.

**What restores the deficit is intensity, not ease.** A single session of 8×4 min at 85 % VO2max expands plasma volume **+10 % within 24 h** ([Gillen 1991](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1761491/)); the taper literature's one consistent instruction is cut volume, hold intensity ([Bosquet 2007 meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17762369/), [Mujika & Padilla 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12840640/)); and cutting intensity is the one reduction that loses adaptations ([Hickson 1985](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3156841/)). A 30-TSS recovery spin as the first day back is the session *least* able to fix what the break actually cost. The "must ramp gently or injury" premise also lacks the evidence base it is assumed to have ([Impellizzeri 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32502973/)) — and it is a running/impact literature besides.

**What the planner does** (`_apply_reentry_shape`, applied at generation when the gap and TSB are known):

| Gap | First week back |
|---|---|
| 1–3 days | Unchanged — three days off costs nothing. |
| 4–7 days | The week's planned quality moves to the first non-rest day at **~70 % volume**; the displaced easy day takes its slot. Intensity kept, ride shortened. |
| 8–14 days | Quality stands but the ceiling drops to threshold (TTE is measurably down by 14 d; the max-aerobic top end waits a week). First quality day at ~60 % volume. |
| ≥15 days | The gap-regen recovery ramp owns it (Mujika/Gabbett — unchanged behaviour). |
| Any gap, TSB still < −5 | Conservative layout left standing, because a rider still fatigued after days of "rest" was probably not resting — illness is the case the planner cannot see. |

No FTP haircut for gaps ≤10 days (VO2max intact — Cullinane); expect submaximal HR to read 6–11 bpm high on the first ride back (Cullinane, Houmard), which the HR-target path should not mistake for over-cooking.

**Honest negatives.** There is no direct evidence on what the first session after a short break should be — zero studies; every branch above is inference from cessation, taper and reduced-training literature. No study measures complete rest shorter than 7 days in trained endurance athletes, none of the anchor studies used cyclists, and none started from an accumulated-fatigue state — the exact use case. The freshness/detraining crossover ("roughly 7–14 days") has never been titrated; the ±4-day uncertainty is real. The 70 %/60 % volume figures are extrapolated from taper volume cuts, not measured optima. TSB near zero is inside model noise ([Busso 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36791017/): best impulse-response models predict at 2–2.7 % MAPE, "not satisfactory for individual training planning"), which is why it gates only at a clearly negative reading and never drives a branch on its own. And no wellness signal here is medical clearance: the illness caution rests on animal models and case series, and every graduated-return protocol is expert consensus.

### 1c. Heart-rate zones: LTHR vs heart-rate reserve

**Two zone models, rider-chosen; LTHR stays the default.** The Karvonen / heart-rate-reserve model (target = rest + fraction × (max − rest)) traces to [Karvonen 1957](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13470504/) — a small training study, not a zone-system validation. Its modern justification is the %HRR ≈ %VO2R equivalence: regression slope 1.00 on the cycle ergometer ([Swain & Leutholtz 1997](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9139182/)), replicated on treadmill ([Swain 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9502363/)) and in elite cyclists ([Lounana 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277600/)). ACSM prescribes by %HRR on that basis: moderate 40–59 %HRR, vigorous 60–89 %HRR ([Garber 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21694556/), carried into GETP12).

**Why it is not the default.** Where the two approaches have been compared, threshold-anchored prescription wins: uniform %HRR assignments produce heterogeneous lactate responses ([Meyer 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10222543/); Mann 2013 review), and the one RCT ([Wolpern 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26146564/)) found threshold-based prescription produced more uniform fitness gains than %HRR. The %HRR–%VO2R equivalence itself is weaker than its reputation: only 6 of 15 eligible studies supported it in [da Cunha 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20833587/)'s systematic review. So: a **measured LTHR beats %HRR**; %HRR is the evidence-based choice **when no threshold test exists**.

**The bands** (consumer-standard, shown against the ACSM classification in the UI): Z1 50–60, Z2 60–70, Z3 70–80, Z4 80–90, Z5 90–100 %HRR.

**The resting anchor.** The literature's anchor is morning resting HR — which the synced daily wellness RHR (Garmin → intervals.icu → Domestique) approximates. **No published standard exists for an averaging window**, so the default — a rolling 7-day *median*, window editable 2–60 days — is practice extrapolation, labeled as such; a median rather than a mean so a single illness spike (a monitoring signal, not a fitness change — Buchheit 2014) cannot drag the zones. A fixed manual value is available for riders who prefer an anchor that never drifts. Eligibility is a sample-count rule (≥4 RHR samples in 14 days), and a measured max HR is required — the profile's age-based fallback (Tanaka 208 − 0.7×age) is fine for display but not for anchoring a band that tops out at 100 % of it.

**Scope, honestly.** HRR drives the **zone table and displays**. Workout prescription (bpm targets in HR mode, the FIT export, hrTSS) stays LTHR-anchored: the prescription pipeline maps %FTP→%LTHR through validated Coggan pairs, **no equivalently validated %FTP→%HRR mapping exists**, and supra-threshold work keeps RPE targets in both models (HR cannot express Z5+; the standing contract stands). Ride-analysis time-in-zone remains bucketed by intervals.icu's zone boundaries, not re-bucketed to HRR. **Honest negatives:** no head-to-head trial of %HRR vs %LTHR zones in trained cyclists exists (Wolpern used sedentary adults and ventilatory thresholds); the %HRR–%VO2R relationship has never been tested during prolonged submaximal exercise; and no study validates any resting-HR averaging window for zone anchoring.

### 2. FTP detection from a regular FIT

Ride a Coggan 20-min test, a Ramp test or a 60-min test in any app, import the FIT (or let the intervals.icu sync bring it in):
- Recognition, in strength order: (1) the structured file you rode — the FIT's embedded workout name and the ICU activity name both carry the workout's display name, and a ride landing on a planned test day is matched against that day's file; (2) a conservative power-profile shape fallback for free-form rides, tuned to stay silent on anything ambiguous (a 2×20 session, a steady endurance hour, a long ride that merely contains a hard hour).
- Suggested FTP: `0.95 x avg 20-min power` (Coggan), `0.75 x best 1-min` (Ramp) or `1.00 x best-hour power` (60-min — definitional). Sparse "smart recording" files are resampled to a strict 1 Hz grid first so a 20-min window is 20 minutes of wall time, not 20 minutes of samples.
- Modal: Update / Keep / Custom. Every change logged to `ftp_test_history` with provenance (`tested_coggan_20min` / `tested_ramp` / `tested_sixty_min` / `eftp_auto` / `manual`) plus a sparkline chart in Settings.
- Ramp auto-halt detection: cadence < 50 + power < 85% target for 3s.
- An abandoned 60-min test (sustained effort under 50 minutes) is never scored by a blind 60-min average — it falls back to the validated 20-min method, and the modal says so.

#### 2a. The FTP test protocols — what the literature actually supports

**The 20-min test (default).** The best-validated field protocol. Borszcz 2018 (PMID 29303908) found 20-min power × 0.95 agreed with 60-min power at the group level (but with individual spread — hence the review modal, never auto-apply); MacInnis 2019 (PMID 30452368) and follow-ups confirmed the correlation in trained riders. The full Coggan protocol *includes* a 5-min all-out effort before the 20-min block: Tramontin 2022 (PMID 34749416) measured that omitting it inflates the 20-min number by ~5% — the anaerobic contribution the blowout is designed to drain. Zwift-style "warm up then just ride 20 minutes" tests skip this and over-read. Domestique's shipped 20-min workout keeps the full protocol: openers, 5-min blowout at ~110%, 9 min recovery, then the test block. Sitko 2023 (PMID 37802084) measured the true 60/20-min ratio by rider level: ~0.96 in professionals falling to ~0.88 in recreational riders — one universal 0.95 flatters weaker riders. When your weight is set, the review modal shows the level-typical band next to the 0.95 default (advisory only; the suggestion itself never moves).

**The ramp test.** Honesty first: the 0.75 × best-minute factor has **no peer-reviewed validation**. Maximal Aerobic Power from a ramp is protocol-dependent (step size and duration change MAP — Luttikholt/Jones lineage), so a single universal fraction cannot be right for everyone; riders with a large anaerobic capacity over-read because the final minutes are partly anaerobic. It survives here because it is short, needs zero pacing skill, and is self-limiting (you ride to failure, no target to mislead you) — a fine *tracking* tool if you always use the same ramp. Domestique serves the 6%/min ladder (the one its auto-halt detector reconstructs) and flags a likely over-read when a trustworthy measured Pmax says you're punchy (Pmax/FTP ≥ 1.35).

**The 60-min test.** FTP is *defined* as quasi-steady-state hour power (Allen & Coggan), so this is the definitional test: factor 1.0, zero estimation error — if you finish it, well paced. That's the catch: it is brutal, and pacing errors are common enough that the calculator scores the *detected* sustained plateau, not a fixed window. No blowout effort is prescribed: over a full hour the anaerobic contribution is negligible, which is exactly why no correction factor is needed. Ride it in resistance/free mode (erg off) — the workout's 100% target is your *old* FTP and the point is to find the new one.

**Excluded protocols.** The 8-min test (×0.90) and multi-stage "progressive" tests have no peer-reviewed validation of their factors either, and unlike the ramp they add pacing skill as a confounder — two unvalidated degrees of freedom instead of one. They stay out of the menu.

**Scheduling.** Tests are placed on fresh legs (the previous day is eased to recovery if the plan put something hard there) on a weeks-since-last-test cadence (~6 weeks), which survives collisions with recovery weeks instead of silently skipping a cycle. Continuous plans get a baselining test in week 2. You can also schedule one manually on any day — the plan re-fits around it, and it refuses a day you already rode hard.

### 3. Capability projection (event preparation)

When you set up a `goal_type=event_preparation` plan with `event_km` and `event_climb_m`, Domestique answers "if I follow this plan can I do it?" via a 4-step model:

1. **Flat-equivalent km** = `event_km + (event_climb_m / 100 x 1.5)` — climbing-distance equivalence heuristic.
2. **Projected average speed** via Pinot & Grappe 2011 (*Int J Sports Med* 32:839-844) RPP table by athlete W/kg + duration tier.
3. **Allen-Coggan IF lookup by duration**: 60min->0.95, 120->0.85, 180->0.80, 300->0.75, 480->0.70, 720->0.62 (linear interp).
4. `predicted_np = IF x FTP`, `predicted_tss = duration_h x IF^2 x 100`. Climb-power gate: required W/kg for the steepest 30-min climb vs your current sustained 30-min.

The dashboard renders three KPI tiles (Endurance Gap / Power Gap / Climb Readiness) plus a dual-axis chart of weeks-to-event vs your longest completed ride and your current sustained 30-min W/kg. `Goal.longest_ride_h_90d` auto-populates from your last 90 days of rides.

**v2.0.0 — the demand model now drives the plan, not just a dashboard.** Until v2.0.0 the projection above was read-only. Now, for `goal_type=event`, those numbers shape the prescription:

- **Long-ride progression (the lever):** the weekend long ride ramps from your current longest toward `0.8 × predicted_finish_h` (`+25 min/week`), capped by your `max_weekend_hours` and a 5 h ceiling, and stops ≥3 weeks out so the taper owns it. Distance + elevation therefore change the plan — a 100 km/500 m and a 175 km/2900 m fondo produce visibly different long-ride schedules. Long-ride *duration*, not a CTL number, is the event-specific signal (TrainingPeaks ATP; Friel; CTS "longest ride 0.7–1.0× event duration").
- **Feasibility-bounded fitness target:** `target_CTL = band[event_type] × (0.94 + 0.12 × difficulty)`, `difficulty = clamp((finish_h − 2)/6, 0, 1)`, then capped by `max_achievable = current_CTL + ramp_rate × (weeks − 2)` — the goal is auto-lowered if the date is too soon rather than prescribing an impossible ramp. CTL is treated as a forecast/anchor, **not** derived from the event (`event_TSS / 7` is dimensionally meaningless and used by no platform — confirmed against TrainingPeaks / intervals.icu / WKO5 / Xert).
- **Climbing specificity:** a route with `event_climb_m / event_km > 12` m/km biases build + peak toward sustained threshold / over-under / VO₂ and away from punchy sprints — phase-gated, because race-specific work belongs in build/peak (Seiler; Rønnestad).
- Applied on initial generation **and** every regenerate / reconcile, so it survives the auto-sync.

**Goal-aware selection (v2.0.0):** independent of any event, an `ftp` goal up-weights threshold + sweet-spot + over-under; a `vo2max` goal up-weights VO2max + Rønnestad-30/15; `ftp_vo2max` / `hybrid` blends both — so the evidence-based protocols come up *more often for the matching focus* (previously the mix was identical regardless of goal).

Method triangulated across PubMed (Seiler 4×8 [21812820], Rønnestad 30/15 [31977120], durability [PMC11235642], MLSS/MCT1 [11683677]), established platform + coach practice (TrainingPeaks Performance-Manager/ATP, Friel CTL-ramp, intervals.icu, WKO5, Xert), and a four-agent adversarial design grill.

### 4. End-to-end planner pipeline

What actually happens when you set a goal and click "Generate plan":

```
Goal(goal_type, target_date, target_ctl, hours_per_week,
     event_km, event_climb_m, longest_ride_h_90d, last_ftp_test_date,
     available_days, daily_max_hours)
   |
   v
_event_demand_targets(goal, athlete, fitness)   # v2.0.0: None for non-event
   |  -> {difficulty, long_target_h, long_start_h, climbing_bias}
   v
generate_phases(goal, current_ctl, event_targets)
   |  applies CTL ramp safety (max +5/week from base CTL)
   |  v2.0.0: event difficulty nudges target CTL ±6%, feasibility-capped
   |  splits into BASE -> BUILD1 -> BUILD2 -> PEAK -> TAPER per goal type
   |  each Phase carries weekly_tss_target, hit_count_min/max,
   |     polarisation target, rest_days_per_week
   v
for each PlannedWeek in plan:
  - pick WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE row for (phase, week_in_phase)
       v2.0.0: goal-aware emphasis (ftp/vo2max/hybrid) + climbing
       emphasis (event_climb, build2/peak only) tilt the HIT-class pick
       e.g. base W3+ -> {endurance: 0.20, tempo: 0.15, sweet_spot: 0.25,
                        threshold: 0.20, vo2max: 0.10, vo2_short: 0.05,
                        recovery: 0.05}
  - allocate session slots across available_days, respecting
       max_weekday_hours / max_weekend_hours, placing the long ride on
       weekend, hard work on Tue/Thu
  - sample_week_workouts() -> for each slot, draw a ZWO file from the
       content-class pool with weight = mix_pref x variety_score x novelty_boost
       where variety_score rewards segment count + zone entropy +
       Ronnestad/microinterval/over-under/sprint patterns, and
       novelty_boost is 5x for never-picked, 0.05x for picked-once,
       effectively forcing 1 pick per file across the plan.
  - _enforce_build2_peak_hard_floor() -> guarantee >=1 anaerobic +
       >=1 neuromuscular + >=3 vo2_short per build2/peak phase
       (post-pass swap if the random sampler missed one)
  - _enforce_ronnestad_floor() -> guarantee >=1 Ronnestad-tagged file
       per build1/build2/peak (Ronnestad et al. 2015)
  - _check_eftp_drift() / _check_dfa_alpha1_low() / _check_decoupling()
       (these annotate the week with auto-adjustment hints; consumed
        on first /api/today-session call of the day)
```

**Daily adaptation** runs every time the dashboard loads:
1. `compute_today_metrics()` — pulls CTL/ATL/TSB + last-3-day decoupling + last-3-day DFA alpha1 + today's daily_log Hooper composite.
2. `compute_readiness()` — produces a 0-100 score weighted HRV 30% / TSB 20% / subjective 20% / sleep 15% / RHR 15%. Components that are missing drop out and the remainder are re-normalised; fewer than 3 available components returns `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` rather than a score. The weights themselves are an assumption — see [§0g](#0g-the-readiness-weights-are-an-assumption).
3. `adjust_today_session(planned, readiness, recent_rides)` — runs the G1–G7 priority chain. First gate that fires sets the description, marks `s.adapted=True`, and returns. If no gate fires, the planned session ships unchanged.

**Re-forecast and regen:**
- `reforecast()` — runs on demand from the UI button. TSB-based hard-session intensity downshift + ACWR weekly TSS scaling + polarisation breach drop.
- `regenerate_from_today()` — full rebuild starting from today's CTL. Triggers when `detect_plan_gaps()` flags >=2 consecutive missed weeks OR `expected_ctl − current_ctl > 15`. **v2.0.0:** carries the same event-demand targets (long-ride progression, feasibility CTL, climbing emphasis) as the initial build, so an event plan does not revert on auto-sync.
- `auto_apply_eftp()` — fires when ICU eFTP > set FTP by >=3% for 7+ consecutive days; bumps FTP with a 48h revert toast.
