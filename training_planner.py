Training Planner — evidence-based periodization engine.

Takes a goal + time budget → generates a full training plan with:
  - Phase structure (base → build → peak → taper)
  - Weekly TSS targets per phase
  - Specific workouts from the 2,459 ZWO library
  - Daily adaptation via readiness/HRV
  - Reforecasting when actual ≠ planned
  - Push to Intervals.icu calendar or local export

Research base: 60+ papers (see RESEARCH_TRAINING_PLANNER.md)

Usage:
  # Define a goal interactively

# extending the classifier we still need to REWRITE plans that were saved
# before the fix — users won't regen manually. This walks the plan and

# the SS slot's fallback chain deliberately admits threshold-class files
# (grill P2: 545/1060 = 51% of the SS-admissible pool is threshold-class —
# the fallback IS the main SS supply), so a threshold-class 3x16min @1.03 FTP
# file rode the fallback onto a SWEET SPOT card while satisfying every
# pre-v2 facts term (1.03 < 1.30 → all burst floors blind; IF 0.806 below
# many legit SS files). R4b closes the hole with a SUSTAINED supra-FTP
# ceiling on the shared SS/tempo row: `l101 < 300` (longest contiguous run
# at >=1.01×FTP under 5min; facts schema v2). Grill-measured: removes
# 32/1060 SS-admissible files (3.0%), every healthy 30-min duration bucket

# legit-SS-class files) ALL stay admissible at the 300s run length; the 5
# legit-class files it drops each hold a genuine >=5min supra-FTP block —
# true positives under the contract (sustained >FTP has no place on an

    athlete trains by heart rate (no power meter). Micro-interval/sprint
    classes (vo2_short/anaerobic/neuromuscular) degrade to all-RPE on a head
    unit, so they take a small score penalty — ONLY when the pool has ≥3
    guidable alternatives (a penalty, never a filter; a slot still fills).
    Callers thread the athlete's target_mode from app.py — match_zwo itself
    never reads profile state (stays a pure function of its args). Default
    False = power mode = bit-identical behaviour.

    Args:
        session: The planned session to match.
        library: Rows from load_workout_library() (flat ZWO library — was
            previously workout_analysis.csv, now parsed directly from the
            .zwo files on disk).
        week_num: Current week number (rotation seed for variety).
        day_idx: Day index within the week (secondary seed).
        used_names: Set of workout names already used this plan — avoids repeats.
        plan_start_date: Anchor date for the deterministic RNG seed so that
            re-matching the same session (e.g. a regenerate-from-today pass)
            always returns the same workout. If None, falls back to the
            session's own date, which is also plan-relative and stable.
        raise_on_empty: If True and no candidate matches, raise
            NoCandidateWorkoutError instead of silently returning with
            ``zwo_file=""``. Default False preserves bulk-plan behaviour where
            ``generate_plan`` surfaces an aggregate warning; ad-hoc rematch
            paths (daily-adapt, reforecast swap-in) set this to True so the UI
            can show a clear error instead of a blank workout.
        seed_salt: v4.3.0 B3 fix — extra entropy mixed into the seed so that
            ``/api/plan/regenerate`` produces a genuinely different ZWO pick
            each time. Defaults to 0 (deterministic mode for testing). When
            non-zero, also shuffles the top-50 score-weighted candidate pool
            so ranked-equal workouts don't always tie-break the same way.
        exact_duration: v1.8.24 — reshuffle/rematch mode. When True the ±25%
            hard duration gate is dropped and the scored candidate pool is
            collapsed to the single CLOSEST-duration tier before the variety
            pick, so the returned workout is the closest the library offers to
            the slot (diff 0 when a same-duration file exists) — never a far
            one. The category/type gate and Score≥3 filter still apply (we
            widen duration only, never workout type). Default False keeps the
            bulk-generation behaviour (±25% gate + score-weighted pick) and the
            v4.5.0 variety/distribution contract byte-for-byte.

# ~1818 score≥5). It drives every non-rest, non-ftp_test slot of a week — the
# legacy `_pick_session` still runs first to lay down the rest-day skeleton +
# 48h HIT-gap structure, but the sampler then overwrites session_type,
# duration_min, tss_estimate, zwo_file, zwo_name on each non-rest slot.
#
# Acceptance: ≥150 distinct ZWOs over a 24-week plan, ≥30 (content_class,
# duration_quintile) tuples, top-5 ZWOs ≤15% of sessions, cross-regen ≥40%
# differ. See /tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_v45.md §3 + §4 for the contract.

    re-testing FTP every 4-6 weeks during build phases. If FTP rises 8% during
    build1 but the planner is still using the old value, all subsequent TSS
    targets and zone boundaries are computed against an FTP that's 8% too low.
    The rider trains harder than the model thinks and accidentally overloads.

    to drift >3% for 7+ consecutive days before bumping FTP. A scheduled test
    is PROACTIVE: a fresh Coggan-20 or Ramp test on day 1 of build2 captures
    the actual current FTP for the next 4-6 weeks of programming.

    Inject points:
      * **Start of build2** — always (covers cycles ≥ 8 weeks).
      * **Start of peak** — only when the cycle is ≥ 16 weeks total
        (long-cycle athletes accumulate enough adaptation to warrant
        a second mid-cycle calibration).

    PREVIOUS calendar day is rest/easy (3.3.1 hotfix — cross week boundary;
    falls back to the first eligible slot) is converted to ``session_type =
    "ftp_test"``. ``match_zwo`` finds a Coggan-20 or Ramp ZWO from the

    the ACWR bound in ``generate_phases`` — already ×0.72 for stepback weeks).
    Before this pass the plan placed one library workout per available day,
    clamped only to per-day availability, so a generous calendar produced a
    ~24.5h / ~1592-TSS week no matter how little the rider had recently been

         proportionally, down to a ``_VOLUME_MIN_SESSION_MIN`` floor;
      2. then converting the lowest-value remaining easy day to REST when a
         session would fall under the floor.

    Invariants held: HIT (key intensity) sessions are never shrunk or dropped;
    the polarized distribution is preserved (only easy volume is shed); at least
    one rest day always remains (converting easy days to rest only adds rest);
    and the last non-rest day is never removed (we stop before emptying the
    week). FC2a (v2.5.0): taper weeks are ENFORCED here too — their ceiling is
    TAPER_FRACS × the actual pre-taper reference (descending into the race) and

    ``taper_only=True`` (FC2a final pass): only taper rows are processed —
    generate_plan calls this a second time AFTER the authoritative per-day
    clamp, so the taper budget anchors on the FINAL build-week sums (the first

# ── R4/R5 (2026-07-07) — R4a: slot/file coherence invariant ──────────────────
# The Tuesday incident (SWEET SPOT 90-min card serving a 118-min threshold
# file) was a DECOUPLING, not a bad match: several passes shrink a slot's
# duration_min in place while keeping zwo_file (the generate-tail TYPE_CEILING
# clamp; _enforce_weekly_volume_ceiling; _enforce_stepback_is_lightest; the
# sampler's 3.2.3 day-cap sweep), so card, chips and file drift apart. The
# exact historical producer is unknowable from a stored plan — so the fix is
# an INVARIANT swept once, LAST, at every plan-emitting tail (generate /
# regenerate_from_today / recalculate_plan / refit_remaining_week), never a
# point patch on one producer (grill A2).
#
# Semantics (grill A1-A3, all measured on 3 pinned 24w plans — 463 filed
# sessions, 25 trips = 5.4%, ALL file>slot, 25/25 fixed by rematch):
#   trip     |file_dur − slot| > max(0.08×slot, 3) + 5 (the reshuffle band
#            + the availability clamp's +5 rounding tolerance)
#   fix      re-run match_zwo at the SLOT duration (exact_duration=True —
#            closest-tier collapse; the type/category gates still apply, so
#            an R4b-cleaned pool can't re-serve a supra-FTP file on SS).
#   A3       if the returned file is STILL out of band (sparse cell), treat
#            as NoCandidate: keep the CLOSER of old/new file.
#   residual DOWN-only re-stamp: slot := min(slot, file_dur). Up-stamping is
#            FORBIDDEN — it re-breaches the availability/TYPE_CEILING caps
#            and the weekly taper/stepback TSS budgets those passes just
#            enforced, and oscillates across recalcs (grill P5: both
#            oscillation modes are up-stamp modes; down-only + last-position
#            = monotone single pass, fixpoint in one application). Since
#            every tail's authoritative clamp ran BEFORE this pass, slot ≤
#            min(day-cap/override, TYPE_CEILING, stepback 150) already, and
#            min(slot, file_dur) can only lower it — the full clamp formula
#            holds without re-deriving caps here.
#   file>slot residual: keep file + keep slot + narrate (the modal's showGap
#            banner renders the gap; the card stays honest about PLANNED
#            time — the rider stops the longer file at the slot budget).
#   easy residual (z2/long_z2/recovery, file<slot): keep + narrate — slot >
#            file is the DOCUMENTED extend-on-trainer contract for
#            unstructured rides (v1.3.4 coverage fallback +

    Selection:

      - session.session_type in ``_HARD_SESSION_TYPES``.
      - session.status is pending (done/done_partial/missed/dismissed skipped).

    Per-session: capture ``before`` snapshot, call ``_drop_intensity``,
    recompute ``tss_estimate`` from ``TSS_PER_HOUR[new_type]``, mark
    ``adapted=True``, re-match ZWO with the prior name in ``used_names``.
    ``NoCandidateWorkoutError`` mid-walk → clear ZWO fields, mark

              a single-session swap (accept-redraw hot path) does NOT change
              the prior week's actual/planned ratio nor the rolling
              polarization split, so re-running those two blocks is wasted

    """v1.5.0 — single-layer reforecast on the persisted plan dict.

    Closes drift class A: callers no longer maintain a separate
    PlannedWeek list and a JSON-dict propagation block. This is the
    only function that mutates `plan_dict` in response to a reforecast.

    Returns: ``(plan_dict, sessions_modified, reforecast_info)``.
    `plan_dict` is the SAME object passed in (mutated in place; not a
    copy). `sessions_modified` is the diff count; `reforecast_info` is
    forwarded from the underlying `reforecast()`.

    `propagation_days` (optional): when provided, the diff-and-write
    block runs against this exact set of iso-date strings instead of
    the default `touched_days ∪ g3_dropped_days` from `reforecast_info`.
    Used by the save-availability endpoint, which propagates the user's
    availability-touched days verbatim (no TSB / G3 inputs on that
    path; same behaviour as pre-v1.5.0).

    `accept_redraw_fast` (v1.8.1 SPEED-B): forwarded to the underlying
    `reforecast()`. When True, skips G3 polarization recompute and G4
    ACWR weekly rescale — the accept-redraw hot path swaps ONE session
    and does not move either signal. Trade-off: weekly tss_target won't
    auto-rescale on a single-session swap; large reshuffles should keep
    the default (False) and call the full path. Availability scaling +
    downstream TSS propagation still run.

    The legacy `reforecast(goal, pw_list, ...)` API is kept as a
    deprecated alias for tests + external callers (removal in v1.6.0).

    The finite-goal recalc regenerates the remaining span toward a fixed
    target and truncates past it — a continuous plan has no target, so the
    horizon must roll instead: every existing week is KEPT verbatim (past
    AND future — an extend never rewrites what the rider already sees), and
    enough new weeks are appended to keep CONTINUOUS_HORIZON_WEEKS ahead of
    today. The 3-load:1-deload cadence continues positionally
    (week_num % STEP_BACK_EVERY), and the mid-cycle FTP retest keeps the
    recalc path's 6-week cadence (IP §5).

    Same return shape as recalculate_plan — (new_phases, all_weeks, info) —
    so the existing auto-recalc write-site works unchanged; recalculate_plan
    routes continuous goals here itself. info["action"]: "extended" when
    weeks were appended, else "no_change" (+ reason).

    The 3.3.1 pool-collapse circuit breaker guards the append exactly like
    the mass rebuild (grill P2): a collapsed pool aborts with no_change so a
    cache fault degrades the horizon (temporarily shorter) instead of
    appending placeholder junk; recalc_date stays stale so it retries.

    HARD session was missed, redistributing the missed stimulus within the
    existing safety guards (no catch-up spike). Decision (b) full re-fit.

    Approach (IP §Design): re-sample the WHOLE current week through the shared
    ``sample_week_workouts`` path (so every guard runs — TYPE_CEILING, the
    sprint IF≤0.82 ceiling, the easy-Z345 ceiling, 48h hard-day spacing, the
    per-phase ``hit_count_max`` cap, polarization, availability), then KEEP
    ONLY the picks for remaining trainable days and splice them over the frozen
    past/done/pinned days. Three INLINE safety passes then run on the spliced
    week (no separate ``_enforce_weekly_hit_cap`` call):
      1. 48h hard-day spacing — MISSED hards are excluded (they imposed no
         load), so they neither create nor block a violation; the shorter
         REMAINING member of any too-close pair is demoted (frozen↔frozen pairs
         are left untouched).
      2. weekly HIT cap, counted with missed hards EXCLUDED so a missed hard
         FREES its slot rather than consuming it; only remaining slots demote.
      3. REDISTRIBUTION (promote) — re-owe each freed missed-hard stimulus onto
         the best SAFE remaining day (one that keeps 48h spacing and stays under
         the cap). When no safe slot remains the stimulus is legitimately
         dropped — never forced into a <48h or over-cap placement (no spike).

    Anti-churn: a remaining day is overwritten ONLY when its session_type OR
    duration actually changes; otherwise the existing session (and its already-
    matched zwo_file) is kept verbatim.

    Determinism: ``seed_salt`` is forwarded into the sampler; the caller derives
    it from (plan_start, week_num, sorted missed dates) so the refit is stable
    and the app-layer latch prevents re-rolling.

    Returns ``(all_weeks, refit_info)``. ``all_weeks`` is the SAME list object
    passed in (the current week's PlannedWeek is mutated in place); refit_info
    carries ``{action, week_num, refit_days, missed_dates}``.

    """PROJECTION-ONLY weekly adaptation (fix26 §6.1, §6.10).

    *** THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT MUTATE THE PLAN. ***

    Per MASTER_DECISIONS_FIX26 §6.1: "Demote daily_adapt_plan to projection-
    only (NO writes)." User intent (§6): "I shuffle workouts; recompute
    shouldn't fight me." The old behavior rewrote `s.tss_estimate`,
    `s.duration_min`, `s.session_type` and even converted rest-days to Z2
    in-place, then the HTTP handler persisted those edits. That fought the
    user — a VO2max moved from Thursday to Monday would get silently
    re-prescribed on sync.

    The new contract:
      * `current_week` is returned UNCHANGED.
      * The diff dict carries `projected_adaptations[]` describing what a
        legacy adapt pass *would* have done — a read-only preview.
      * §6.10: remaining_sessions is filtered by `status == "pending"`, not
        by calendar date. A user-moved VO2max sitting on Monday instead of
