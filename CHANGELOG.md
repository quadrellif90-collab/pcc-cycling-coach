# Changelog

## v3.5.2 — Cooldowns that actually cool down (2026-07-21)

- **776 workouts ended with a "cooldown" that ramped UP.** The chart drew it descending, but the file told chronological trainer apps (MyWhoosh, Tacx) to ramp from 25% to 75% FTP at the end of the ride — one tester finished a VO2max session with an unplanned climb to threshold. All 776 now genuinely descend, matching the 2,873 workouts that were already authored correctly, and the descriptions say what the file does. One bonus find: a 30-second "cooldown" to 130% FTP. A permanent test keeps ascending cooldowns out of the library for good.

## v3.5.1 — One press to ride the original, and see it first (2026-07-21)

- **"Ride the original … anyway" works on the first press.** A security check pinned the app to its default port; served on any other port, every button press was silently rejected — the modal just stayed open. The check now accepts any local port (and still blocks anything that isn't your own machine).
- **Preview before you commit.** The adjusted-day modal's "Original plan" block now opens into a real chart of the workout it would restore — the actual intervals at your watts, captioned as exactly what "Ride the original anyway" brings back. Collapsed by default so the adjusted session stays the riding instruction.

## v3.5.0 — Honest numbers, and hard days that stay off your easy days (2026-07-21)

- **Workout TSS is correct now — and most numbers go up.** Workouts were scored with a formula that under-read intervals and surges, while your *rides* were scored the standard way — so planned and completed training were in different units, which also skewed the load-ramp safety check. Both now use the method intervals.icu and TrainingPeaks use. Expect ~+9% on a typical workout, more on sharp intervals, almost nothing on steady endurance. Past rides and completed weeks were not rewritten.
- **Hard sessions can no longer land on your recovery days.** The old scoring flattened spikes, so genuinely hard workouts slipped under the "easy enough to rest on" line — most over/unders and two-thirds of anaerobic sessions were eligible for recovery slots. Not any more.
- **A workout that emptied the tank is fixed.** One anaerobic session ended each half with two back-to-back 2-minute efforts at 120% — a 4-minute wall nobody intended, left behind when an old safety pass flattened a rising finisher into two identical blocks. Now a single 2-minute effort per half. Three other workouts had the same scar and were repaired too.
- **Workout names tell the truth.** A file claiming 76 minutes was 67. Three more were labelled recovery or endurance while holding efforts up to 150% — including a "recovery spin" that ends with a minute at 118%.
- **Session details show the real workout's load,** not the planner's estimate for that slot. The plan's target appears as a footnote only when the two genuinely disagree.
- Under the hood: Domestique can now compare a prescribed workout against the power you actually delivered, rep by rep — groundwork for judging whether a session was really completed, not just whether the total looked right.

## v3.4.4 — Pick your window, and a plan grid that tells you things (2026-07-20)

- **Filter Fitness & Form by any date range** — intervals.icu-style: preset
  chips (1m/42d/3m/6m/1y/All), one chip per year of your data, and a
  two-month calendar picker with quick links. Your choice is remembered.
- **The chart's hover/drag now lines up with the graph** (it was offset
  left and right of the plot).
- **The plan grid speaks again:** each card shows the workout's actual
  structure name, duration · TSS, and missed/done at full prominence — and
  its mini power sprite always shows the file you'll actually ride. An
  internal quality number that leaked onto the cards is gone.
- **Workout buttons say what they do:** "↻ Swap workout — same type,
  different session" and "⇄ Change training type (VO2, tempo, …)" — and
  their info popups now open from the home page too (they only worked from
  the Plan tab).


## v3.4.3 — The calendar lands on today, and every day says whose day it is (2026-07-16)

- **The Training Plan calendar opens on today.** No more scrolling through
  past weeks — it lands on the current week automatically (and the "Jump to
  today" button now works reliably too; it previously scrolled the page
  instead of the calendar, and could aim at yesterday shortly after
  midnight).
- **Every day view says which day it is.** "Today — SWEET SPOT (60min)" vs
  "Saturday 18 Jul — TEMPO (38min) · in 2 days" — clicking around past and
  future weeks can never read as today again.
- **The home card can no longer show a stale session.** Opening the plan tab
  can rewrite today (missed-session re-fit); the home card now refreshes
  itself right after, so Home and Plan always tell the same story.
- **All three "change this workout" buttons have working explainers.**
- **First plan on a fresh install works.** Generating could fail with an
  error on brand-new installs (a summary file was written before its folder
  existed).
- Under the hood: the test suite is now fully isolated from your real data
  (a development-only hazard), and the dev preview runs on a sandbox copy.


## v3.4.2 — DFA is back, clearer choices, and a wizard that asks the right question first (2026-07-14)

- **DFA α1 works again on the home card and the DFA tab.** The readings could
  vanish entirely; both surfaces now show your values, a live progress state
  while rides index or compute, and an honest empty state only when there's
  genuinely nothing.
- **Adjustment choices name the actual workouts.** Instead of "keep original?"
  you now see "Planned: SWEET SPOT — Sweet Spot Steady, 80min → Now: Z2,
  60min" with buttons that say exactly what each does: "✓ Ride the easier Z2
  (60min)" or "Ride the original SWEET SPOT anyway".
- **The plan wizard asks the big question first:** 🎯 Train toward a goal, or
  ♾ Train continuously — two cards at the top. Continuous mode then shows
  only what applies: no misleading weeks number (a rolling-horizon note
  instead), and the "I've been training already" scan explains that
  continuous plans place themselves from your rides automatically.
- **Changing a workout speaks rider:** one "Change this workout" menu —
  "Give me a different workout", "Change the type…", "Make it easier today" —
  plus "Skip today" with what happens next ("the week re-fits — nothing
  piles up"). Same actions, no more planner jargon.
- **Fatigue Resistance has a "?"** explaining what it measures and why some
  rides are excluded.
- **Profile hygiene:** each rider profile now keeps its own sync timestamps —
  switching profiles can no longer skip a fresh profile's first sync, and
  disconnecting an account truly resets it. Existing installs keep their
  sync state (no mass re-download).


## v3.4.1 — Honest loading, and the card and the click finally agree (2026-07-14)

- **Fatigue Resistance can't get stuck at 93% anymore.** Rides that
  permanently lack power data (some Strava-imported rides, empty records)
  were being retried forever, holding the progress bar hostage — while your
  computed score sat hidden behind it. Those rides now count as done, the
  bar reaches an honest 100% with a small "N rides have no power data"
  note, and your results show even while caching is still running.
- **The power-curve progress bar is back.** It had been rendering into a
  part of the page that no longer exists (since June), so the chart just
  appeared "after a while" with no feedback. The bar and its auto-refresh
  live again in the chart card.
- **"No rides indexed yet" became a live progress bar.** The home Recovery
  section now shows the actual intervals.icu sync ("Indexing rides… 39 of
  45") and refreshes itself when done. The DFA tab shows its update strip
  while computing, too.
- **Fatigue Resistance and Recovery details are always open** — real
  panels, no more hidden fold.
- **Clicking an adjusted day now shows the adjusted session.** The home
  card could say "Z2 today" while the click opened the original sweet-spot
  workout with 95% ramps and no explanation. The day view now leads with
  the session you're actually meant to ride, shows why, keeps the original
  plan in a labeled fold-out, and gives you the choice: ride the adjusted
  version or keep the original. Downloads and calendar pushes follow your
  choice — never the workout the app just told you to skip.
- **"Keep original" and the DFA banner's Revert now actually revert** all
  adjustment types (previously only some — for the rest the button was a
  silent no-op).
- Progress bars no longer flash to "Loading…" between refreshes; the
  adjustment banner says its reason once, in plain zone-accurate language;
  today's workout preview is centered; text contrast improved in both
  themes.


## v3.4.0 — Continuous training: a plan that never ends (2026-07-13)

- **New goal type: "Continuous — keep improving."** No end date, no taper —
  pick a focus (FTP, VO2max, or both) and the plan maintains a rolling
  4-week horizon that extends itself every week: three loading weeks, one
  recovery week, forever.
- **It reads your body, not just the calendar.** Each morning the home card
  suggests today's stimulus — low-aerobic, high-aerobic, or anaerobic —
  from your HRV (against your own baseline), form, zone deficits and how
  recently you went hard ("Today: high-aerobic — HRV in band, 32min Z4
  deficit"). Hard days are only suggested when HRV is in band, following
  the HRV-guided-training trials this mode is built on.
- **Recovery arrives when you need it, not just when it's scheduled.** If
  training strain spikes (Foster monotony ≥2 or sharp load ramps), the
  recovery week is pulled forward — announced on the today card with the
  reason and a one-click revert.
- **Ten new short sprint workouts (33-44min)** with full recoveries, so
  busy days can still carry real neuromuscular work — the short-sprint
  shelf had only 3 options.
- Progress surfaces speak continuous: "Rolling week N · next deload in X
  days" instead of "Week X of Y", a rolling 4-week phase strip with the
  recovery week hatched, and deload/retest countdowns. Classic finite
  plans render exactly as before.


## v3.3.3 — Starting mid-season actually works now (2026-07-13)

- **"Find my week from recent rides" no longer parks you at the finish
  line.** The scan always credited the maximum — week 11 of 12 — leaving one
  easy wind-down week and an apparently empty future. It now reserves at
  least 4 trainable weeks, and a start date that would leave nothing to ride
  is refused with a clear message instead of generating an empty plan.
- **The scan is a real flow now.** Live progress while scanning; a result
  card that says where you are ("Matched your last 8 weeks — you're at week
  9 of 12") with a "why?" breakdown; a consequence line; plan-length choices
  (16/20/26 weeks or custom) each showing an instant phase-strip preview
  from your position — you are here, what remains, when it ends; one-click
  Generate; and afterwards the plan opens on TODAY, not week 1.
- **Changing your goal or plan length visibly resets the scan** — the old
  start date can never silently ride along again.
- **The green ring on the calendar is the plan's last day** (now labelled) —
  it was never "today"; today keeps its own marker.
- **Under-distributed custom phase splits (11 of 12 weeks) now show a
  prominent error** at the bottom of the editor and block Generate until the
  weeks add up.
- **Your wizard hours now seed the availability calendar** — saying "1h per
  day" no longer leaves the calendar at its old 2h.


## v3.3.2 — Hotfix: opening the Training Plan tab could flatten your plan (2026-07-12)

Follow-up to this morning's v3.3.1, again from the same tester's report —
thank you.

### Fixed
- **Opening the Training Plan tab no longer rebuilds your plan.** For
  FTP/general/VO2max goals within ~3 weeks of their target date, the weekly
  auto-recalculation wrongly decided a race taper was due (these goals have
  no race — but the readiness math didn't know that) and rebuilt the whole
  remaining plan as one all-Z2 taper block, showing only "Taper" in the
  overview. Tapers are now reserved for goal types that actually finish
  with an event, exactly like plan generation always did.
- **"Regenerate plan" now counts as a recalculation.** It didn't refresh
  the recalc timestamp, so the tab kept re-triggering the auto-recalc on
  every visit — which is why the flatten came back each time you fixed it.
- **A readiness hiccup can't trigger a rebuild.** If the readiness numbers
  fail to compute on a fresh plan, the tab now just shows the plan.


## v3.3.1 — Hotfix: upgraded installs could lose workout matching (2026-07-12)

If you upgraded to v3.3.0 and your plan suddenly filled with identical
"Z2 steady" placeholder sessions, or Rematch kept saying "no candidate" —
this release is for you, and it repairs the damage automatically. Huge
thanks to the tester whose detailed report and log made the diagnosis fast.

### The root cause, honestly
v3.3.0's app package was missing one internal helper the workout-analysis
step needs. Fresh installs never noticed (they ship with the analysis
pre-computed), but on upgraded installs with an existing workout folder the
app tried to re-analyze the library, failed for every file, and then
recorded "unusable" for all 4,000+ workouts — permanently. From that moment
the planner couldn't match ANY workout: every reshuffle failed, and the
next automatic plan recalculation rebuilt your future weeks as empty Z2
placeholders.

### Fixed
- **The missing helper is back in the package**, and the analysis step now
  treats "the helper itself is broken" as an installation problem instead
  of a verdict on your workouts: it keeps the previous analysis (slightly
  stale beats catastrophically wrong) and never again marks the whole
  library unusable in one sweep.
- **Poisoned installs heal themselves.** On first launch of 3.3.1 the app
  detects workouts that were wrongly marked unusable and re-analyzes them.
  No manual steps, no reinstall.
- **Plans can no longer be flattened.** If the workout pool ever comes back
  effectively empty, the automatic recalculation now refuses to rebuild and
  keeps your existing plan untouched, telling you why — instead of
  replacing every future session with placeholders.
- **The mid-plan FTP test is only ever scheduled the day after a rest or
  easy day.** It could previously land right after a heavy interval session
  (one tester got it inside a 4-hard-days-in-a-row stretch) — a test on
  cooked legs reads low and poisons every target built on it. It now also
  counts as a hard day itself, so the 48-hour spacing rule and the weekly
  hard-day limit protect the days around it in both directions.
- **The "adjusted" day card tells one story.** When readiness caps your day
  (say, threshold → Z2), the chart previously still drew the original
  threshold blocks while the targets showed Z2. Chart, chips and label now
  all describe the session you'll actually ride.
- **Reshuffle on a thin day retries properly** (same smarter search the
  preview flow already had) and, when there's genuinely nothing to offer,
  says the day keeps its zone targets instead of "failed".
- **Manually changing a day's workout type now updates your intervals.icu
  calendar.** The old pushed event was being protected as "broken" forever;
  a deliberate change now sweeps it correctly. Sync errors from
  intervals.icu are also logged with the actual reason now, so a stuck sync
  is diagnosable from your log file.
- **"Download ZWO" works on manually-changed days** (the save dialog never
  appeared in the desktop app; FIT already worked).
- **Implausible automatic FTP updates are rejected.** One tester's profile
  ended up at 122W (real FTP ~258) — every power target scaled off it. An
  automatic update that drops FTP below 100W or by more than 40% in one
  step is now refused and logged. Anything you type in yourself is always
  respected.

### Also in this release
- **Send any workout to your intervals.icu calendar.** Every workout detail
  view — in the training planner and in the library — has a "Send to
  intervals.icu calendar" button. Planned sessions go to their scheduled
  day with one click; library workouts get a date picker (default:
  tomorrow) and stay on your calendar permanently, untouched by the plan's
  automatic sync. Your head unit (Garmin/Wahoo/Hammerhead) and MyWhoosh
  pull the workout with its full power or heart-rate targets — no file
  copying. A "?" next to the button explains the flow. Works even with
  calendar auto-sync switched off (it only needs the calendar permission
  from Reconnect). Riders on heart-rate targets without a set LTHR get a
  clear message instead of a wrong-targets file.
- **Help popovers are readable again.** They were transparent (text from
  the page bled through — worst on the Settings tab); an undefined style
  variable was the cause, and fixing it also repaired three other panels
  that quietly used it.

### For the tester who hit this
Update, launch once, and your library re-analyzes itself. Then open the
Training Plan tab and press Generate Plan once to rebuild the flattened
weeks (your ride history and settings are untouched). If your FTP shows a
wrong low number, correct it once in Settings — the guard prevents the
regression from now on.


## v3.3.0 — Every workout rideable, a search that speaks cyclist (2026-07-07)

The whole release is built around one tester day: an impossible 3×16min at
103% FTP landed on a sweet-spot day, the library search felt dead, and a
brutal sprint session didn't ease the next day's plan.

### New
- **W′-feasibility audit of the entire library.** Every one of 4,200+
  workouts was simulated against the critical-power model (generous
  anaerobic-reserve settings, ramp tests exempt). 90 physiologically
  impossible files were fixed class-aware: sprint workouts kept their watts
  and gained real recoveries; interval workouts were re-set to
  protocol-correct intensities; 3 files had their work/rest encoding
  inverted and were corrected. 40 borderline files are logged and monitored.
- **Rønnestad 30/15s in literature-true doses.** New 2/3/4-set variants at
  115/110/106% — the canonical prescription (~110% for 3×13) instead of the
  130% pacing that turns the session anaerobic and cuts the VO2max stimulus.
  The old 130% files were re-set to match.
- **A search bar that understands you.** "threshold 3x16", "ss 90min",
  ">120 vo2", "30/15", "rønnestad", "@105" — structure, duration, intensity
  and class families parsed from free text, typo-tolerant, relevance-ranked,
  matches highlighted, with a "understood: …" echo. "/" focuses, Esc clears.
- **Sprint days now echo into tomorrow.** A ride with 8+ minutes in Z6/Z7 —
  planned or not — eases the next day's hard session one notch, with the
  reason on the card and a revert button. Low-TSS/high-glycolytic rides were
  invisible to the load model before.

### Fixed
- **A sweet-spot day can never serve an over-FTP file again.** New engine
  gate: files with sustained blocks above FTP are inadmissible for
  sweet-spot and tempo slots (the workout facts layer now sees intensity
  from 101% up — it was blind below 130%).
- **The card, the chips and the file always agree.** A coherence pass at
  every plan-building tail rematches any session whose file duration drifts
  from its slot (the "90-minute slot carrying a 118-minute file" class —
  28/28 fixed on pinned plans, verified stable).
- **Weekly recalculation respects your daily time limits** (it was the one
  path without the availability clamp).
- **Library search actually responds.** Typing was racing itself: every
  keystroke re-parsed all 4,200 files server-side and a slower earlier response
  could overwrite the results. Parsing is cached (under 100ms), stale
  responses are discarded, and a "Showing N of M" line always tells you
  what happened. Long workouts (up to 240min) are reachable again, the
  gravel filter finds sweet-spot rides again, and searching "vo2" no longer
  hides the short/ladder variants.
- **"6 rides reconciled" on every planner open** — it was the week's total,
  re-announced. Now it only reports genuinely new matches.
- The workout table dropped two misleading columns: the constant "Category"
  and the internal quality score (it rated workouts by intensity, so an
  impossible file scored 7/10 and a perfect 3-hour Z2 ride scored 2).


## v3.2.3 — Your available time is a hard limit (2026-07-06)

Fixes for the three most-reported issues from testers, all in the planner's
core promise: what lands on your calendar fits the time you said you have.

### Fixed
- **Workouts now always fit the time you gave the planner.** If you set a day
  to 60 minutes, you could still find a 90-minute session on it — the cap was
  enforced on the main selection path but leaked through several side doors
  (variety swaps, weekly load redistribution, phase-variety fills). Every path
  now honours your per-day limit, with one final safety clamp behind them all,
  and the workout card always narrates the duration you'll actually ride.
- **Reshuffle no longer repeats itself.** On slots with few same-length
  alternatives, "Reshuffle (try another)" could offer the same workout on
  every click. After a few attempts it now also reaches for slightly shorter
  workouts — never longer than your day allows — so you get a genuinely
  different suggestion.
- **Updating via Homebrew works again.** `brew upgrade domestique` had failed
  with a 404 since v3.2.1 — the release file was named differently from what
  the formula expects. Both affected releases carry the correctly-named file
  now; no action needed on your side.

### Improved
- **Recalculated plans keep their variety guarantees.** The automatic weekly
  recalculation quietly skipped the rules that guarantee over-unders, sprints
  and short-VO2 work in every build phase — after a few weeks a recalculated
  plan could drift into a narrower mix than a freshly generated one. Those
  rules now run on every recalculation, and your completed or hand-moved
  sessions are never touched in the process.
- **Profile safety:** switching rider profiles while ride power data is
  downloading in the background can no longer file that data under the wrong
  profile — the download stops cleanly and resumes for the right rider.


## v3.2.2 — Smarter training variety: 597 hidden workouts join the planner (2026-07-05)

- **~600 workouts your plan could never pick are now in rotation.** Ladder
  intervals (steps up/down through threshold, VO2 and sweet spot), tempo
  intervals, and endurance rides with sprinkled strides were in the library
  but invisible to the week planner — it now draws on all of them, so plans
  get visibly more varied without changing your load targets.
- **Threshold work can no longer vanish from build weeks.** On unlucky rolls
  the build phases could end up with zero threshold sessions (everything went
  to shorter, punchier work). Every build now guarantees the classic four —
  threshold, VO2max, sweet spot and over-unders.
- **Block periodization concentrates harder.** When a focus block added
  sessions of its focus quality, it under-counted how much the week grew —
  focus share could drop below half. The block math now accounts for that.
- **FTP-test files can't sneak onto normal training days** through the
  workout pools anymore (a handful of untagged test files could).
- Under the hood: the "reshuffle gives you the closest-duration workout"
  guarantee is now verified against the planner's real selection rules (57
  long-dormant checks re-enabled and passing).


## v3.2.1 — Analysis-tab fixes: the power curve finally draws (2026-07-05)

- **Power curve now renders.** It could hang indefinitely (blank chart) while it
  cached your ride power from intervals.icu — that hydration now runs in the
  background, the chart appears right away, and a progress bar shows it filling
  in. Fatigue Resistance, which shares the same data, no longer gets stuck.
- **Home card shows the right session.** It could say "Rest" while opening your
  actual ride for the day (a plan starting mid-week). The card and the click now
  read the same source.
- **Sleep & HRV never show a bare "—" anymore.** Until your watch's overnight
  data reaches intervals.icu (usually mid-morning), the tiles show your last
  synced day in italics with its date — color keeps meaning good/bad — plus a
  note saying exactly what you're looking at. Applies to RHR too.
- **Preview today's workout on the home page.** The Today card now shows the
  actual interval blocks of today's session — the real workout file when one
  is matched, or an approximate shape for free rides — and the card sits
  directly above the This Week grid so today and the week read as one unit.
- **First run** shows a "Create your first training plan" button instead of an
  empty card.
- Plan-tab polish: a clearer "I've been training already" box, a "Find my week
  from recent rides" option, readable links in dark mode, and a tidier plan-style
  help popover.


## v3.2.0 — Personalize your plan, and a workout library you can trust (2026-07-05)

The biggest release yet. You get real control over how your plan is shaped and
how you test your fitness; every workout is now matched by what it actually
contains rather than the name it was filed under; and a batch of new sessions
plus a wave of honest fixes land across the board.

### Shape your own plan
- **Phase editor — set your own base / build / peak / taper split.** The phase
  timeline on the Training Plan tab is now interactive: step each phase's week
  count up or down and the plan redraws as you go. You stay within safe limits
  (a race taper can't vanish, the peak can't balloon), or press **Recommended**
  to snap back to the automatic split. Useful when you want, say, an extra base
  week or a longer peak than the default gives you — previously the split was
  fixed and could jump around by a week as your event date shifted.
- **Mid-plan entry — "I've been training already."** When you build or rebuild a
  plan you can now tell Domestique you didn't start today, two ways:
  - **I know my start date** — pick the day your block actually began. The plan
    is laid out over the full runway from that date, the weeks you've already
    done are marked complete, and you drop in at the week you're really on — no
    repeating a base phase you already rode.
  - **Place me from my rides** — Domestique reads your recent training and
    proposes which week you're on, so a rebuild lands you where your fitness
    actually is instead of at week one.

### A workout library you can trust
- **Every session matches its slot — by content, not by label.** Workouts are
  now admitted to a plan slot based on what they actually contain (their real
  efforts, durations and intensities), not just the category they were filed
  under. A sprint day gives you sprints; a sweet-spot day stays sweet spot. The
  two problems a tester hit this week — a brutal neuromuscular session served on
  an easy day, and 700-watt spikes hiding under a "sweet spot" title — are now
  impossible by construction, and locked down with tests so they can't return.
- **The whole 4,000+ workout library was audited and corrected.** Around a
  hundred files whose label disagreed with their real content were reclassified
  to the truth, each one checked by hand. The mislabelling had a root cause in
  the classifier itself (it read a staircase warm-up as a ramp-to-failure, among
  other slips) — those rules are fixed, so the corrections hold on future
  updates instead of drifting back.
- **"FTP test" now actually means an FTP test.** 67 of the 75 workouts filed as
  "FTP test" weren't tests at all — they were threshold, over-under or sweet-spot
  sessions wearing the wrong name. They're reclassified, and the real 20-minute
  test gains the 5-minute all-out effort that drains your sprint reserve first
  (skipping that is the single biggest cause of an over-read FTP).
- **~30 new sessions.** VO2 ladders at 30/15, 40/20 and 15/15 microbursts in 2-,
  3- and 4-set lengths; threshold over-unders; sweet-spot builds; and a proper
  2×8-minute (CTS-style) field test the library had been missing.
- **Honest workout charts.** A preview drawn from a generic template (rather than
  the real file) is now clearly labelled as an estimate, and the chart never
  draws a target harder than the session really is.

### Test your FTP your way
- **Choose ramp or 20-minute — per test.** Open an FTP-test day in your plan and
  a chooser leads the screen: two cards, each with a sketch of the power profile
  and honest pros and cons, so you pick with your eyes open.
  - **Ramp** — power steps up about 20 W a minute until you can't hold on; your
    FTP is 75% of your best minute. Quick and easy to pace, but it leans on your
    anaerobic system near the top, so punchy riders tend to read high.
  - **20-minute** — a 5-minute all-out effort drains your reserve, then a
    20-minute maximal effort; your FTP is 95% of that average. More accurate for
    threshold, but longer, and pacing is unforgiving — go out too hard and you
    fade, reading low.
  Pick a card and that session's workout swaps to it. There's no global setting
  to hunt for — you choose in the moment, for that test.
- **Your FTP is read from the effort itself.** When you finish a test, Domestique
  works the number out from your actual ride. The ramp takes your best *sustained*
  minute on the ramp, so a stray sprint in your warm-up or spin-down can no longer
  inflate the result; the 20-minute test trims a finish-line kick before
  averaging. It suggests the new FTP and lets you approve it — and if your measured
  sprint power says the ramp likely read high, it flags that so you can adjust.

### Train to your own numbers
- **Short intervals capped to your measured power (opt-in).** If you have a
  measured peak-power number, Domestique can hold a workout's short, very-hard
  efforts to what you can actually produce — you approve it per workout, or leave
  it off entirely. It's grounded in critical-power sports science and uses your
  real measured numbers, not a model's estimate. (We read the research first and
  deliberately did *not* ship the tempting-but-unsound version that predicts your
  interval power from a fatigue model — the literature shows that over-reads at
  exactly these short durations.)

### Under the hood
- **Your plan settings survive a rebuild.** Regenerate, add-race and the weekly
  auto-recalc now keep everything — your intensity distribution, custom zone
  bands, B/C races and a backdated start — instead of quietly resetting to
  defaults after an app restart.
- **Recalc no longer loses your work.** Race days and the sessions you've
  completed, moved or dismissed now survive a weekly recalculation.
- **First-run setup polish.** Inline validation as you type, a native folder
  picker instead of typing paths, clearer wording on the data-folders step, and
  a small "from intervals.icu" tag on any value that was prefilled from your
  account.

## v3.1.0 — Your plan survives upgrades, and plans can start in the past (2026-07-04)

### Upgrade no longer loses your training plan

- Fixed: upgrading from a 2.x version could bring back an old, long-replaced
  plan instead of your current one. The app now finds your real plan from the
  old location on first launch, restores it automatically, and tells you it
  did. Your previous files are kept as backups — nothing is deleted.
- If this already happened to you: install this update and your original plan
  comes back on its own. (The plan you re-created is kept in backups too.)

### Start a plan mid-way — "I've been training already"

- New option when creating or rebuilding a plan: tick "I've been training
  already" and pick the date your training actually started. The plan is laid
  out over the full runway from that date, the weeks you've already done are
  marked as completed, and you enter exactly where you are — no repeating the
  base phase you already rode.
- Works for every goal type; the phase preview shows the same backdated
  timeline you'll get. Your fitness numbers still come from your actual ride
  history, so a backdated plan never prescribes more than you're ready for.

## v3.0.2 — Fix intervals.icu connect error (2026-07-03)

- Fixed connecting (or reconnecting) to intervals.icu failing with a
  "Duplicate scope CALENDAR" error — introduced in v3.0.1 alongside the new
  calendar push. If v3.0.1 showed you that error, just update and connect
  again.

## v3.0.1 — Send workouts straight to intervals.icu (2026-07-03)

- New on the Training Plan tab: **Push to intervals.icu calendar** sends your
  next 14 days of planned workouts to your intervals.icu calendar — Garmin and
  MyWhoosh pick them up from there automatically. No more exporting and
  uploading files by hand.
- Optional **Keep intervals.icu calendar in sync** setting (off by default):
  after any plan change your calendar is updated automatically, and once a day
  the window rolls forward on its own.
- Training by heart rate? Your workouts are pushed with heart-rate targets.
  Power-based plans push the original workout files unchanged.
- Safe by design: Domestique only ever touches the calendar entries it created
  — your races, notes, and anything you added yourself stay put, even on the
  same day. Turning sync off (or disconnecting) removes Domestique's entries
  and nothing else. One Domestique install per athlete.
- Existing intervals.icu connections are read-only: the button will ask for a
  one-click reconnect to grant calendar permission the first time.

## v3.0.0 — Train by heart rate, race-ready plans, and a new Analysis tab (2026-07-02)

### Headline: train without a power meter

- **Heart-rate training mode.** Pick "Heart rate" under Workout targets in
  Settings and every workout speaks bpm: steady aerobic segments get a heart-rate
  range derived from your LTHR, short and very hard efforts are prescribed by
  feel (RPE) — because heart rate reacts too slowly to guide them — and long
  steady rides warn about cardiac drift. FIT downloads carry real heart-rate
  targets to your Garmin, Wahoo or Hammerhead, with effort cues for the sprints.
  A Watts ⇄ HR toggle in every workout view previews either version, and the
  downloaded file always matches what you're looking at. Recovery and cooldown
  steps only get ceilings — no more "HR too low" beeps for riding easy on an
  easy day.
- **Your numbers stay honest.** LTHR syncs automatically from your intervals.icu
  rides unless you set it yourself; a tunable HR-targets editor lets you adjust
  the prescription ranges; and rides without power now count toward your fitness
  through a heart-rate-based load estimate, clearly labelled.

### Race-ready event plans

- Tapers now actually taper: volume steps down into race week instead of ramping
  up, the day before your race is a short openers ride, no hard training lands
  within two days of any race, and the race day itself can never be overwritten,
  shrunk, moved or dismissed by any automatic adjustment. B-races get mini-tapers
  with openers too. Race-tomorrow plans are an honest race-week micro-plan, past
  dates are refused with a clear message, and re-planning near a race no longer
  produces duplicate or post-race training days.

### See yourself in one place

- **New Analysis tab** gathers the diagnostics that used to crowd the home page
  (fitness & form, power curve, energy systems, model panels) — home now opens
  to today's decision with a compact fitness sparkline.
- **Rider Profile** at the top of Analysis: FTP, eFTP, W/kg, CP / W′ / Pmax,
  90-day peak efforts, VO2max (via Intervals.icu), LTHR / max HR / resting HR,
  threshold estimates, efficiency trend, decoupling, training load and season
  totals — every number shows where it came from and how fresh it is.
- **Execution scores.** Completed sessions get a 0–100 "did you ride what was
  prescribed?" score with a breakdown, power- or heart-rate-based.
- **Retest reminders.** When your FTP or LTHR goes stale, a dismissible nudge
  offers to schedule a test week (or shows the LTHR field-test protocol in HR
  mode).

### Setup, accounts and reliability

- First-run setup actually appears on new installs, asks how you train
  (power meter or heart rate), imports your numbers over the intervals.icu
  connection, validates everything with readable errors, and no longer invents
  values you didn't enter.
- Multiple athletes on one computer are now fully separated: rides, wellness,
  workout libraries and connections can't leak between profiles — including
  during profile switches mid-sync — and disconnecting an intervals.icu account
  cleans up its data properly.
- Workout library: 66 more hand-verified label corrections, so hard sessions
  can't hide as easy ones and easy days can't serve intervals.
- Plans are transparent about adapting: a small chip offers a re-plan when your
  fitness has drifted meaningfully from the plan's assumptions.
- FIT workout files confirmed importing correctly into TrainingPeaks, Vekta and
  Garmin platforms.

## v2.4.5 — Clearer workout charts (2026-07-01)

### What changes for users

- **Anaerobic efforts (≥121% FTP) in the workout chart are now purple, not red** — so a 150% spike is distinct from threshold/VO2 work at a glance.
- **The Z7 (neuromuscular) row in a ride's zone breakdown is now high-contrast** instead of a near-invisible dark grey.

## v2.4.4 — Workout library re-classified so hard sessions aren't hidden as easy (2026-07-01)

### What changes for users

Workouts that were labelled "Zone 2" or "Recovery" but actually contain hard efforts are now labelled for what they really are:

- **Easy rides with short hard *strides* → "Endurance + Strides".** A Z2 base ride with, say, 6× 20-second pops is still nice to ride and still an aerobic day — it just isn't scheduled as pure Zone 2.
- **Rides with sustained hard sets → their real type.** Workouts with threshold blocks, VO2 intervals, or over-unders that had been mislabelled as endurance or recovery are now labelled Threshold / VO2max / Anaerobic, so they land on the right training days — and a hard session is never served on a recovery day.

## v2.4.3 — FIT workout targets as %FTP + full-calendar day view (2026-07-01)

### What changes for users

- **FIT workouts now target %FTP, not fixed watts.** Downloaded FIT workouts scale to your FTP on the device / in TrainingPeaks (matching how ZWO works), which also imports more reliably.
- **A day with both a workout and a ride shows both.** Clicking any day — in This Week *or* the full calendar — now lists the scheduled workout (open / rematch / download) *and* every activity you did (details). Previously, doing an activity before your scheduled workout hid the workout behind the completed ride.

## v2.4.2 — FIT workouts import into TrainingPeaks / Vekta (2026-06-30)

Downloaded FIT workouts were rejected with "no workout in this file" by TrainingPeaks and Vekta. The file was valid, but its steps had no names — which those apps require. Every step is now named, matching Garmin's own workout-file format.

### What changes for users

- **FIT workout downloads import correctly** into TrainingPeaks, Vekta, and other structured-workout tools — each warm-up / interval / cool-down step is now named.
- **Clearer ZWO vs FIT guidance** on the download: same workout, two formats — pick whichever your app reads (many devices read either; e.g. a Hammerhead takes both). ZWO drives indoor trainer apps; FIT is for bike computers and workout platforms.

## v2.4.1 — Sharper DFA threshold estimate + instant help tooltips (2026-06-30)

The DFA aerobic/anaerobic threshold estimate now leans on your cleaner rides and ignores ones where your heart rate drifted (which skew the result), so it reflects your true thresholds better. Plus the "?" help bubbles pop up instantly instead of after a delay.

### What changes for users

- **Better threshold estimate.** HRVT1/HRVT2 is now a confidence-weighted average of your recent, well-measured, low-drift rides — fatigued/drifting rides are left out (they push the threshold artificially low). The panel shows how many rides were excluded and why.
- **Instant help tooltips.** Hovering the "?" icons (e.g. Block periodization) shows the explanation immediately instead of after a ~1-second delay.

## v2.4.0 — Proper warm-ups & cool-downs, multi-activity days, FIT imports (2026-06-30)

A bundled release pulling together the warm-up overhaul plus the recent activity and FIT fixes.

**Every workout now has a proper warm-up and cool-down.** Hard sessions get a longer ramp, easy rides a shorter one — scaled to the session. Your plan is unaffected: a 90-minute slot is still 90 minutes (warm-up included, not bolted on top), and the day view now shows the warm-up / main-set / cool-down split so you can see exactly how the time breaks down.

**Multiple activities on one day all show and count.** Did a commute plus your main session? Both now appear, with a combined-load total — and the day's TSS adds up so on-track tracking and plan adaptation see your real load. A run or swim on a planned day no longer masks a missed ride or inflates the week.

**FIT workout downloads import into TrainingPeaks / Vekta / Garmin.** They were opening empty (the file was missing a creation-date stamp those apps require) — now fixed, with warm-up and cool-down ramps intact.

## v2.3.1 — Custom intensity mix moved onto the Template picker (2026-06-28)

A fix for v2.3.0: the intensity-mix percentages and the editable custom split were attached to the wrong control, so the built-in templates showed no percentages and there was no place to enter your own. They now live on the plan Template picker, where you'd expect them.

### What changes for users

- Pick **Plan style → Template** and the template's typical training-type mix now shows (e.g. Polarized Base ≈ 80% easy with a VO2max lean; FTP Builder ≈ 72% easy with a sweet-spot lean).
- Choose the new **Custom** template to set your own split across Tempo/Sweet-Spot, Threshold, VO2max and Sprint, with a live check that it totals 100%.
- After you generate a plan, the readout switches to the **actual** training-type mix it produced.

## v2.3.0 — Custom intensity mix, swap any day's training type, automatic rescheduling

- **Choose your own intensity mix.** The intensity model now has a **Custom** option: set how
  your hard training is split across Tempo/Sweet-Spot, Threshold, VO2max and Sprint. The built-in
  models show their typical mix when you pick them, and after you generate a plan it shows the
  **actual** training-type breakdown it produced — so what you ask for is what you get.
- **Swap a day's training type.** Every day's detail view has a new **Swap type** button: pick a
  different type — even a VO2max in the middle of a base block — and a duration, and that day
  changes, gets a matching workout, and the rest of your plan rebalances around it. You can still
  re-roll the workout afterwards.
- **Missed sessions reschedule themselves.** The "Reschedule missed sessions?" prompt is gone.
  Miss a session and the plan now moves it to a free day that same week automatically — nothing to
  click.
- **Climbs open from every tab again.** Opening a climb from the All Routes or Virtual tabs failed
  with a "profile load failed" error. Routes now open correctly from all tabs.

## v2.2.16 — macOS Monterey (12) / Big Sur (11): really fixed this time

- **The Mac app now launches on Monterey (12) and Big Sur (11).** v2.2.15's fix was incomplete — the
  embedded Python itself was still built for newer macOS and called system functions that don't exist
  on Monterey, so it failed to open. The app's Python is now built for older macOS. Same Python
  version, same features — it just runs where it should now.

## v2.2.15 — Runs on macOS Monterey (12) and Big Sur (11)

- **The Mac app now launches on macOS Monterey (12) and Big Sur (11).** Recent builds were
  accidentally compiled against newer macOS, so on Monterey they failed to open — silently, even from
  the DMG. The app is now built to run on macOS 11 and up. No features changed.

## v2.2.14 — Races show on the calendar + a longer pre-race taper

- **Your races now show on the calendar.** Adding a race (your main event or a B/C race) used to
  re-plan around it but still showed a training session on race day — e.g. a 6-hour Z2 on Marmotte
  day. The race day now shows the **race itself** (🏁 with name + distance + climb): on the calendar,
  in "This Week" when it's race week, and on the home Today card on the day.
- **A longer, evidence-based pre-race taper.** The final easy days before your main race went from 2
  to 3 (B-race mini-tapers likewise) — light spins and openers, not complete rest, so you arrive
  fresh without losing sharpness.

## v2.2.13 — Workouts that actually match the plan

- **The workout you get matches the day.** A "sprint" day could pull a 57-minute session that was
  mostly threshold — the title, the duration, and the power chart all disagreed, and it wasn't really
  a sprint workout. Now each day picks a workout whose **type and length both fit the plan**: sprint
  days get genuine sprint sessions, and a 45-minute slot gets a ~45-minute file (not a 57-minute one),
  so the title, the duration, and the chart agree.
- **Mislabelled sprint workouts are reclassified.** Files that were just a few short sprints bolted
  onto a long tempo/threshold block are now filed under their real focus, so they stop turning up on
  sprint days.
- **More true max-effort sprint sessions** added to the library — short, very-high-power efforts with
  full recovery — so sprint days have proper options at every length.

## v2.2.11 — Clearer "This Week", full today's-session, steadier sync bar

- **Today's session opens the full workout.** Clicking today's session on the home page now opens
  the same detailed card as the plan — power profile + Download ZWO / FIT + rematch — instead of a
  stripped-down summary.
- **"This Week" makes today obvious and shows what you did.** Today now has a clear TODAY badge (no
  longer mistaken for a green "completed" day), each day shows a ✓ done / ✕ missed marker, and
  clicking a day opens how it went.
- **The sync banner no longer jumps around.** It was bouncing ("11 of 49 → 30 → 16…") when two syncs
  overlapped; syncs are now serialized so the count climbs smoothly.
- **Removed the redundant "Sync now" button** from This Week — the app already syncs automatically
  when it opens.

## v2.2.10 — DFA α1 thresholds fixed + live update progress

- **Your DFA thresholds are back.** The DFA tab had started showing "No thresholds
  detected yet" with no rides computed. The step that cleans up heart-rate-variability
  data was throwing away almost every beat on any ride with a normal warm-up, so there
  was nothing left to analyse. Fixed — your aerobic and anaerobic thresholds (HRVT1 /
  HRVT2) compute again.
- **The DFA tab shows progress while it updates.** When rides are computing you now see
  how many are eligible and how far along it is ("Updating 4 of 9"), with a progress bar,
  and the panel refreshes itself when it's done.

## v2.2.9 — Sticky FTP, real sync progress, DFA that survives a re-sync

- **Your FTP stays where you set it.** Saving a manual FTP used to appear to snap back to
  the lower estimated FTP in the top bar and Settings until you restarted the app. It now
  updates everywhere the moment you save.
- **The sync banner shows real progress.** Instead of a vague "Syncing activities…" that
  could sit there with no numbers, it now shows how many activities are syncing and how
  many are new ("Syncing 3 of 20 · 2 new"), and clears itself when it's done.
- **DFA thresholds survive a re-sync.** Re-syncing a ride could wipe its computed DFA
  values and blank the threshold panel. Those values are now kept across syncs.

*Follows v2.2.8, which restored syncing for accounts signed in with intervals.icu that
had silently stopped pulling new rides.*

## v2.2.8 — Fix intervals.icu sync for OAuth accounts (recent rides not indexed)

- **Recent rides weren't syncing for OAuth-connected accounts.** The sync gate only
  recognised the legacy API-key login (`ICU_API_KEY`), so anyone who connected with
  "Sign in with intervals.icu" (OAuth — which has no API key, just a Bearer token)
  silently stopped syncing: new rides never got indexed in the planner even though the
  connection was valid and `training.py` authenticated fine. The gate now also accepts
  the OAuth access token, mirroring how requests already authenticate. If you were
  affected, your rides catch up automatically on the next open (or hit "Sync now").

## v2.2.7 — Workout downloads + goal persistence (issues #5/#6)

- **Workout downloads no longer save empty files.** On macOS, ZWO and FIT workout
  downloads could occasionally save as empty (0-byte) files. They now always save the
  real workout — and if one genuinely can't be produced, you get a clear error instead
  of a useless empty file.
- **Your training goal sticks after a restart.** Picking a goal like "Hybrid FTP +
  VO2max" and reopening the app used to reset the shown goal back to "Event". The goal
  you chose now stays selected.
- **Faster home page** on large ride histories.

## v2.2.6 — One "Today" card (issue #3)

- **One readiness recommendation, not five.** The home page had several overlapping
  "how ready am I today" panels on two different scales, so you could see "rest" on one
  and "you're fine" on another at the same time. They're now a single **Today** card: one
  readiness score, one state (Ready / Ease off / Rest), and one suggested action. When your
  morning leg-check overrides the score, the card explains why ("Rest advised — from your
  leg-check") instead of contradicting itself, and the separate gauge is now clearly
  labelled as a trend/analytics view.

## v2.2.5 — Strava-ride clarity, lighter recovery weeks, sane tier-down (issues #2/#3/#4)

- **#2 — blank Strava rides + log spam.** intervals.icu's API can't read Strava-synced
  activities at all (summary, streams, fit-file all return 422 "Cannot read Strava activities
  via the API" — Strava's terms), so the ride detail was blank and the log filled with 422
  warnings. Now: 422-on-streams is DEBUG (no spam), the detail renders whatever's available, and
  a clear note explains it — Garmin doesn't restrict this, so connect Garmin → intervals.icu for
  automatic full detail, with a direct link to export your Garmin history.
- **#4 — recovery weeks are now visibly light.** A deload could end up with MORE hours + the same
  single rest day as its build weeks (low TSS via easy Z2). It now also gets more rest days +
  fewer hours than every build week in its block — unmistakably a recovery week.
- **#3 — readiness tier-down no longer increases load.** A "tier-down" vo2max → threshold raised
  TSS at the same duration (90/h > 75/h; rider saw 64 → 76.5). The duration is now capped so a
  tier-down never raises load. On a severe day (high soreness → forced recovery) "auto-adjust"
  drops hard sessions all the way to easy in one pass instead of one tier at a time. (The visual
  merge of the three "today" cards — issue #3 Request 2 — is a follow-up.)

## v2.2.4 — Add races to a live plan, clearer plan setup, sign-in reliability

### Planning
- **Add a B/C race to an existing plan** (`POST /api/plan/add-race`, "+ Add race" on the plan):
  appends it and re-periodizes forward — an easy taper into the race + recovery after — preserving
  past weeks, completions, your A-event date and plan length (reshape, not a rebuild).
- **Plan configuration round-trips.** The form (Plan style · Intensity model · Block periodization ·
  per-day availability · B/C races) now mirrors the saved plan on load — it previously always reset
  to defaults, so a fixed-core plan read as "Automatic." Grouped under a "Plan configuration"
  heading with a one-line active-config summary on the plan.

### intervals.icu reliability
- **A missing-scope 403 is no longer treated as a dead token.** `/athlete/0` (athlete-number
  prefill) needs `SETTINGS:READ`, which we don't request → 403; that was conflated with a 401 and
  wrongly nagged a connected rider to reconnect. Only a 401 now triggers reconnect.
- **Settings connection UI** reads "✓ Logged in as <name>" when connected; the reconnect button
  shows only when actually disconnected.

### Carried from v2.2.1–v2.2.3 (now one stable build)
- One-button planning (single Generate Plan + auto-update after sync / on tab-open); header sync
  chip + version label; first-sync progress strip; phantom power-duration card removed.
- Windows: OAuth "exchange" fixed (CI bundles the client_secret + asserts it); native window starts
  first-try (Mark-of-the-Web strip); sign-in/sync events logged.

## v2.2.3 — One-button planning, header sync chip + version, first-sync progress

- **Plan tab simplified to ONE button.** Removed the redundant *Update plan* and
  *Rebuild from scratch* buttons. **Generate Plan** creates the plan, or rebuilds it
  from current settings + fitness when one already exists (confirm-first so it can't
  wipe an adapted plan). The plan then updates itself automatically after every ride
  sync and on every plan-tab open (runPlanOpenSequence → /api/plan/update). The
  contextual gap-alert "Update plan" (only when behind in an event taper) and the
  per-day Rematch stay; the mark-unavailable "Save & Regenerate" is unchanged.
- **Header sync chip + version label.** A spinner + "Updating activities X/Y" sits next
  to the logo while a sync/backfill runs; the version number shows beside the title.
- **Reliable first-sync progress.** pollFirstSyncTopbar runs on every dashboard load
  (not gated like the old power-curve path) so a freshly-linked rider sees the
  "Syncing activities X of Y (NN%)" strip. Removed the legacy duplicate "Power
  Duration Curve" card that showed a loading block then vanished.

## v2.2.2 — Windows OAuth fix (bundle the client secret in CI)

- **Fixed: "intervals.icu connection failed — exchange" on Windows.** The OAuth
  client_secret lives in a gitignored `.oauth.env`, so the CI checkout that builds
  the Windows EXE never had it — the frozen build shipped an EMPTY secret and ICU
  rejected the token exchange. CI now writes `.oauth.env` from a repo secret
  (`ICU_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`) before the build, failing loudly if it's unset.
  macOS was unaffected (its DMG is built locally where the secret exists).
- OAuth diagnostics: the token-exchange path now logs the HTTP status + body and a
  missing-secret warning, so a build-config regression shows up in "Copy logs".
- **Fixed: Windows "built-in window could not start" dialog on first launch.** Files
  extracted from the downloaded zip carry Mark-of-the-Web (Internet-zone), which made
  .NET refuse to resolve types from the bundled managed `Python.Runtime.dll` (pywebview's
  pythonnet/EdgeChromium backend) on the cold start — it self-healed on reopen. The launcher
  now strips the `Zone.Identifier` ADS from the bundled pythonnet assemblies before loading
  the CLR (root fix, no code-signing needed), with a short in-process retry as a safety net.
  Installing via an installer (vs running the raw zip from Downloads) also avoids this.

## v2.2.1 — Fix the "Raise FTP" button + logs that capture sign-in & sync (2026-06-20)

A fast patch on **v2.2.0**.

- **“Raise FTP” works.** The new FTP-rise banner’s button errored with “Could not
  raise FTP” (it sent an unsupported test method); it now applies the estimate and
  recomputes your zones.
- **Logs capture sign-in + sync.** `Settings → Copy logs` now records the
  intervals.icu sign-in (start / connected / denied) and each sync (with
  wellness + activity counts), so a bug report is actually actionable. (v2.2.0
  already switched to a single small capped log file that the viewer reads.)

## v2.2.0 — Sign in with intervals.icu, plan styles, customizable zones (2026-06-20)

A feature release on top of v2.1.2. Headline: **sign in with intervals.icu**
(OAuth — no more API keys), a choice of **plan styles**, **customizable training
zones**, and a batch of reliability + first-run polish. Everything from the
v2.1.x line is unchanged and listed below.

### Sign in with intervals.icu (OAuth)
- **One-click sign-in instead of API keys.** Linking your account is now an
  explicit, **retryable** step: click **Sign in to intervals.icu**, log in + approve
  in your browser, and it links that account to the profile — the setup screen
  then shows **“✓ Linked as <name>”**. Per profile, so multi-rider setups each
  link their own account.
- **Existing API-key users get prompted to switch.** A banner offers a one-click
  move to sign-in (your key keeps working until you do).
- **Athlete numbers prefill from intervals.icu.** After linking, the setup’s
  FTP / weight / LTHR / max-HR are filled in from your account (still editable).
- **Settings → “Copy from intervals.icu”** pulls your real (e)FTP so the plan’s
  % targets use true numbers.

### Plan styles — choose how the plan is built
A **Plan style** selector (default unchanged):
- **Automatic (varied)** — today’s behaviour (full-library sampler).
- **Fixed-core (repeatable)** — one quality session type per phase that progresses
  by reps on a constant Z2 base; deterministic, doesn’t reshuffle on update.
- **Template** — a ready-made fixed-core blueprint (**Polarized Base**, **FTP
  Builder**).

### Customizable training zones
- **Edit** button on Power Zones **and** HR Zones in Settings — boundaries are
  prefilled (auto from FTP/LTHR) but fully editable, with **Reset to auto**. Custom
  zones are honored everywhere (display + ride time-in-zone analysis).

### Reliability fixes (from a tester’s report)
- **Day-detail popup tells one story** — titles by the planned slot (type /
  duration / TSS); the matched library file is one calm secondary line with a
  plain “ride N min of it / add easy Z2” note instead of an alarming mismatch.
- **Easy days stay easy** — a Z2/recovery slot can’t pull an interval-structured
  file; it re-matches to a genuine endurance file and recomputes TSS.
- **Recovery weeks recover** — a deload is the lightest week in its block, carries
  no hard intervals, and caps the long ride at 2.5 h.
- **Reversible whole-plan overview**, and the opaque **`O/U`** label is now
  **Over-Under**.
- **B/C races on any plan** — intermediate races (with mini-tapers) work on FTP /
  VO2max / general plans, not just event-prep.

### First-run & quality-of-life
- **First-sync is visible** — a top-bar **“Syncing activities X of Y (NN%)”** with
  a spinner while your history indexes from intervals.icu (was a bare “Loading…”).
- **FTP-rise prompt** — a prominent top banner appears only when your FTP actually
  looks **higher** than set, with one click to raise it + update zones.
- **Logs no longer balloon** — Domestique now keeps a single small capped log
  (~3 MB) and auto-cleans the old per-launch logs (some installs had grown to
  multiple GB).
- Fixed a **“readiness NaN”** flash on the plan-open checklist for new accounts.

## v2.1.2 — DFA recovery + a reliable "update available" banner (2026-06-19)

A small patch on top of v2.1.1, fixing two bugs found in testing.

- **DFA thresholds come back.** Rides could get stuck on "no thresholds detected"
  even with valid HRV data. intervals.icu's RR-interval (`hrv`) stream lags the
  initial sync, so a ride was transiently flagged `no_rr_data` — and that flag was
  *permanent*, so the ride never recomputed once the data arrived (a flagged ride
  actually had 29k RR-intervals available on a re-fetch). It's no longer permanent:
  such rides automatically re-check and recover their α1 + HRVT1/HRVT2.
- **The "update available" banner actually appears.** The update check cached
  GitHub's latest release for 6 h, so a new release published while the app was
  closed stayed invisible until the cache expired. The app now forces a fresh check
  on startup and re-checks every few hours, so a new version shows up on the next
  launch instead of up to 6 h later.

Everything from **v2.1.1** (faster plan open, polarized event-prep for all goal
types, non-cycling activities kept out of the plan, citation fixes) and the big
**v2.1.0** feature release is below.

## v2.1.1 — Faster plan open, polarized event-prep, citation fixes (2026-06-19)

A fast-follow patch on top of **v2.1.0** — whose full feature set (block
periodization, B/C races, the smarter plan, Windows/Mac reliability) is recapped
at the end of this entry and detailed in the v2.1.0 section below. Nothing from
v2.1.0 is replaced; this adds fixes on top.

### Training plan
- **Plans are now properly polarized (all goal types).** Build/peak weeks were
  coming out as a few hard sessions + rest days — the weekly volume ceiling was
  trimming the easy Z2 endurance days to rest. Now, for **every goal** (event,
  FTP, VO2max, hybrid, general, endurance, …), the easy aerobic base fills the
  available days up to your **ACWR-safe load** (recent weekly TSS × 1.3, Gabbett)
  instead of resting them, so a build week is a polarized **HIT + Z2** mix, not
  "hard + rest". Stepback (deload) and taper weeks keep their reduced volume.
  Evidence that high low-intensity volume builds the aerobic base:
  [Seiler & Kjerland 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16430681/),
  [Stöggl & Sperlich 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578968/),
  [Rosenblat 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29863593/) /
  [2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39888556/).
- **Opening the training plan is fast again.** It stalled ~30s on "Checking what
  you actually did" because it waited for the slow, best-effort ride **sync**
  before the local reconcile. The sync now runs in the **background**, and the
  recovery/HRV read runs in **parallel** with the reconcile — the plan opens at
  reconcile speed.
- **Non-cycling activities no longer pollute the plan.** A Strava rock-climb (or
  run / swim / hike) was being matched to planned cycling sessions. Non-cycling
  activities are now excluded from reconciliation.
- **Clearer reshuffle message.** Accepting a workout reshuffle now reads "Today's
  training changed · N future sessions reflowed" instead of an ambiguous "0
  sessions reflowed".

### DFA / interface
- **DFA α1 tab shows a loading screen.** Opening the tab paints a spinner
  immediately while the analysis loads in the background, instead of a blank or
  stale panel.

### Docs
- **Fixed 4 wrong PubMed links** that pointed to unrelated medical papers
  (Sanders / Wallace / Vermeire / Hellard), linked every study in the guardrail +
  science tables, consolidated one complete scientific-reference table, and
  corrected the DFA HRVT2 citation (was reusing the LT1 paper).

### Plus everything from v2.1.0 (the feature release this builds on)
v2.1.1 is a patch — the headline features all shipped in **v2.1.0**, recapped here
so they aren't buried (full detail in the v2.1.0 entry below):

- **Block periodization (opt-in, default off)** — reorganizes build/peak into ~3–4
  week focus blocks (a VO2max block, then a threshold block toward your event),
  each keeping one complementary session (Issurin "accentuated load"). Saved with
  the plan and survives every auto re-fit. Grounded in a verified PubMed screen,
  and honest that the evidence is mixed for amateurs — hence off by default.
- **B and C races** — add intermediate events alongside your A goal, each with a
  right-sized, evidence-based **mini-taper** (B: a 2-day volume trim that keeps
  intensity; C: a single easy/opener day), skipped inside the A taper or a deload
  week, and color-coded by priority on the calendar. A single-A plan is unchanged.
- **A plan that respects your real training** — weekly volume is **load-based**
  (the lower of target CTL and recent 6-week TSS × 1.3, not the sum of your free
  hours), starts from your **real current CTL**, restores real **rest weeks/days**,
  keeps **VO2max off race eve**, and lets you choose **polarized / pyramidal /
  threshold** — all of which now hold through automatic re-fits.
- **An honest workout library** — an objective-coherence check surfaces a workout's
  hidden hard work in its name (e.g. *"Endurance 120min — Z2 +VO2 set"*); added 24
  long pure-Z2 base rides for gran-fondo base (library now 4,220 workouts).
- **A trustworthy DFA α1 readout** — per-window α1 can read down to 0.20 (hard-
  interval drops shown, not hidden), each result carries a **high/medium/low
  confidence** flag, and running activities are flagged not-fully-trusted.
- **Outdoor-ready workouts** — an opt-in export wraps any workout with an *off-plan*
  transit warm-up + easy spin home (doesn't touch your planned load).
- **Windows + macOS reliability** — profile, API-key and accented-name persistence,
  clean app relaunch (no orphaned server), and the recurring intervals.icu
  **TLS fix — now on both platforms** (the ICUNetworkError on Windows *and* the
  Mac mini / MacBook Air).
- **FTP / power / safety** — eFTP no longer silently rewrites your zones (opt-in);
  the power curve self-heals missing efforts; an impossible 600%-FTP "ramp" workout
  was removed and the dangerous-workout screen tightened.

## v2.1.0 — Block periodization, B/C races, a smarter plan, and Windows/Mac reliability (2026-06-19)

The biggest release yet — and the first upload since v2.0.7. It bundles a large
Windows-feedback reliability round, a training plan that builds from your *real*
fitness, and a new training-science layer: an opt-in block-periodization engine,
support for **B and C races** with their own mini-tapers, a workout library that
stops lying about what it contains, long base rides for gran-fondo riders, a
trustworthy DFA α1 readout, an outdoor-ready workout export, and the intervals.icu
TLS fix — now on **both Windows and macOS**.

Everything new here is **additive or opt-in** — if you change nothing, your plans
look exactly as they did. One requested item (volume-scaled hard-day count) is
**not** in this release; see "Still on the list."

### Block periodization (opt-in, new)

- **Focus your build on one quality at a time.** A new **"Block periodization"**
  checkbox on the plan form reorganizes your build/peak phases into ~3–4 week
  **blocks**, each concentrating one quality — a **VO2max block** first, then a
  **threshold block** toward your event — instead of mixing every hard type every
  week. Each block keeps one complementary session so you don't lose the other
  qualities entirely (the Issurin "accentuated load" model).
- **Grounded in the evidence.** The block template is built from a PubMed screen
  (Rønnestad's block-VO2 cycling RCTs, Issurin, a 2019 meta-analysis — every
  citation verified). The honest version: block periodization shows a VO2max/power
  edge in *trained* cyclists but the evidence is mixed and not proven for
  time-crunched amateurs — so it's **off by default**, offered for those who want
  to try it, not forced on anyone.
- **It sticks.** Your block choice is saved with the plan and survives every
  automatic re-fit/recalc, so an adapted plan stays a block plan.

| Default plan (unchanged) | With "Block periodization" on |
|---|---|
| Every build week mixes VO2 + threshold + sweet-spot + over-under | Build1 = a VO2 block, build2/peak = a threshold block |
| Variety every week | One concentrated focus per block + 1 complementary session |

### B and C races (opt-in, new)

- **Plan around your whole season, not just one event.** Alongside your A goal you
  can now add **B and C races** — the plan form takes a repeatable list of events,
  each with a priority. Add a local crit in the middle of your fondo build and the
  plan accounts for it instead of ignoring it.
- **Each gets a right-sized mini-taper.** A **B race** gets a short 2-day freshen
  (trim volume, *keep* intensity — a pre-race opener is fine, not a smashfest); a
  **C race** gets a single easy/opener day and is otherwise ridden through. Neither
  is a full taper — your A event still owns the real peak.
- **No double-deloads.** A B/C event that falls inside your A taper, or on an
  existing unload week, is left alone — no stacking easy on easy.
- **Grounded in the evidence.** The mini-taper window and magnitude come from a
  PubMed taper screen (Mujika & Padilla, Bosquet's meta-analysis, Rønnestad's
  between-races peaking — every citation verified): maintain intensity, cut volume,
  keep the window short.
- **See them on the calendar.** Event days are color-coded by priority (A / B / C).
  A plan with only an A event behaves exactly as before.

### Your workout library got honest

- **Workouts stop hiding hard sets.** The library labels a workout by its dominant
  zone, so an "Endurance — Z2" file could secretly contain a VO2 set. Each workout
  now carries an **objective-coherence** check, and incoherent files get the hidden
  work surfaced in their name — e.g. **"Endurance 120min — Z2 +VO2 set"** — so what
  you see is what you'll ride. (No files were changed; only the labels got honest.)
- **Long pure-Z2 base rides for gran-fondo riders.** Added 24 clean steady
  endurance rides from 195 up to 240 minutes (the library capped at 180 before), so
  long-base weeks have proper options. Every new file passed the
  classify-before-write gate. Library is now 4,220 workouts.

### A DFA α1 readout you can trust

- **Hard-interval drops are no longer hidden.** α1 genuinely collapses below 0.30
  during hard intervals (a Gimenez set), but the app used to discard those readings
  as "unphysiological," so you saw a gap instead of a low value. Per-window α1 can
  now read down to 0.20 (the whole-ride average is still sanity-floored), so a hard
  effort shows up as a hard effort.
- **A confidence flag.** Each DFA result now reports **high / medium / low**
  confidence from the artifact rate, the window yield, and the activity's sport —
  so a noisy reading is *labelled*, not silently trusted.
- **Running is flagged, not trusted blindly.** Optical/RR jitter on runs produced
  unreliable α1; running activities are now capped at "medium" confidence (the
  feature stays available for runners — it's labelled, not disabled).

### Outdoor-ready workouts

- **Ride a structured session as a real outdoor ride.** An opt-in **"Outdoor
  variant"** on the Library download wraps any workout with a flat transit warm-up
  to the climb and an easy spin home. Those extra minutes are **off-plan** (easy
  riding that is *not* counted against your planned weekly load), so your plan's
  numbers stay clean.

### Under the hood

- The block engine is gated behind the toggle with a "default-off parity" guard, so
  the default plan is byte-for-byte unchanged; fixed a latent bug where a
  pyramidal/threshold distribution choice reverted to polarized on a recalc.
- Focused regression tests for every feature above; the planner's known
  non-deterministic coverage tests are unchanged.

### Windows reliability + a plan that respects your real training

A large round of fixes driven by detailed Windows-user feedback. Three buckets:
**(1)** Windows stopped fighting you — your profile, API key, and the app window
now survive a restart. **(2)** The training plan now builds from your *actual*
fitness and a sane weekly load instead of blindly filling every available hour,
adds real rest, keeps hard intervals away from race day, and lets you choose your
intensity distribution instead of forcing polarized. **(3)** eFTP can no longer
silently rewrite your FTP and zones, the power curve self-heals, and a couple of
data/scoring inconsistencies are gone.

### Windows: your settings actually persist now

- **Your profile no longer resets on reopen.** Weight, FTP, zones, and athlete
  details stuck at defaults (e.g. weight snapping to 70 kg, FTP to 200 W) every
  time you reopened the app, and saves to the profile silently evaporated. Root
  cause: the profile registry was being written *empty* before the first-run
  migration could create your default profile, so the app booted with no active
  profile and fell back to built-in defaults. Fixed — your profile is created and
  loaded correctly, and edits persist.
- **You can change your API key / athlete ID and have it stick.** Same root cause
  — with no active profile, credential saves had nowhere to land. Now they save to
  the active profile and survive a restart.
- **Names with accents no longer break saving.** A profile name like "Raphaël"
  produced an "invalid profile id" / "Save failed: 400" because the accented
  character slipped past the ID validator. Names are now folded to a safe ASCII id
  (e.g. `raphael`), so any name saves cleanly.
- **The app reopens after you close it.** On Windows the close button left the
  background server running and the port bound, so relaunching just popped a blank
  browser tab (and you had to kill it from Task Manager). The window-close path now
  fully shuts the server down and exits, so the next launch starts fresh.

| Before (Windows) | After |
|---|---|
| Reopen → weight 70 / FTP 200, edits lost | Profile + edits persist across restarts |
| API key won't save / "invalid profile id" | Credentials and accented names save cleanly |
| Close → won't reopen, kill via Task Manager | Clean shutdown; relaunch works |
| "ICU rejected credentials: ICUNetworkError" | TLS certificates bundled — ICU connects |

> Note: the three Windows-specific fixes (clean exit, certificate bundling, port
> release) are verified in code but need confirming on an actual Windows build.

### Connecting to intervals.icu (TLS) — Windows and macOS

- **"Saved, but ICU rejected the new credentials: failed: ICUNetworkError" is
  fixed.** The frozen Windows build *and* the notarized macOS app shipped without a
  certificate-authority store, so every HTTPS call to intervals.icu failed
  verification — the "ICUNetworkError" reported on Windows, and the same failure on
  the Mac mini / MacBook Air. The app now bundles the `certifi` CA store and points
  both platforms at it, so credential checks and syncs succeed. (This is the
  recurring issue reported on GitHub.)

### Your training plan got a lot smarter

- **Weekly volume is based on training load, not the sum of your free time.**
  Before, the plan put one workout on every available day and stretched each to
  your per-day time limit — if you said you *could* train 24 hours a week, it
  scheduled ~24 hours, which is how you'd get hurt. Now the week is capped by a
  load-based ceiling: the lower of your target fitness (CTL) and your recent
  6-week average weekly TSS × 1.3 (a standard safe ramp). Your daily availability
  is now just a per-session *ceiling*, not a target to fill. Example: a rider
  averaging ~400 TSS/week now gets ~540 TSS (~10 h), not 24.5 h. This holds
  whether your rides live on intervals.icu or as local files: if you have no
  recent ride history yet (fresh install / ICU-only), the ceiling anchors on your
  current fitness (CTL × 7) instead of falling back to the old availability cap.
- **The plan starts from your actual fitness.** It used to begin every plan from a
  hardcoded "post-winter" baseline, ignoring the racing and training you'd just
  done. It now reads your real current CTL (from intervals.icu, or computed from
  your local ride history) so the ramp starts where you actually are.
- **Real rest weeks and rest days.** With sane volume, the planner's unload weeks
  (every 4th week, lighter load) are visible again, and excess easy days are
  converted to genuine rest days — so a normal week gets at least one day off
  instead of seven days of training. (The "no recovery days" complaint was a
  side-effect of the over-scheduling above.)
- **No VO2max the day before your A event.** The taper kept prescribing hard
  intervals right up to race day. Now any hard session within the final 2 days
  before your target event is demoted to a short, easy opener. A pre-race sharpener
  is still allowed a few days out — just not a smashfest on the eve.
- **You choose your intensity distribution.** Polarized was forced on every plan.
  You can now pick **Polarized** (default — mostly easy + a little very hard),
  **Pyramidal** (more threshold work), or **Threshold / Sweet-spot** from the plan
  form. Switching models changes only the *kind* of hard work (where your intensity
  minutes go), not the total load, hard-session count, or easy volume — and your
  choice is remembered and respected when the plan auto-adjusts.

| Before (plan) | After |
|---|---|
| Volume = sum of your available hours (up to ~24 h/wk) | Volume capped by real load (target CTL / recent TSS × 1.3) |
| Every plan starts from a fixed post-winter baseline | Starts from your actual current CTL |
| Rarely a rest day; hard to see unload weeks | ≥1 rest day per normal week; unload weeks visible |
| VO2max intervals on race eve | Final 2 days before the event are easy openers |
| Polarized forced | Choose polarized / pyramidal / threshold |

### The plan stays correct when it auto-adjusts

Domestique re-optimizes your plan after you miss a session or sync new rides. Two
fixes make those automatic adjustments trustworthy:

- **Your event is never forgotten.** When the plan rebuilt or rebalanced itself it
  used to lose your event date and details — which silently disabled the race-day
  protections below. Your goal event now survives every auto-adjustment.
- **No hard session sneaks back onto race week.** The "no VO2max before your event"
  rule previously applied only when you first *generated* the plan; a later
  auto-adjustment could quietly put intensity back on the final days. The guard now
  re-applies on every rebuild, reforecast, and missed-session re-fit — so once your
  taper is set, it stays a taper.

### FTP / eFTP

- **eFTP can no longer silently rewrite your FTP and all your zones.** After 7
  days of sustained upward eFTP drift the app used to overwrite your FTP
  automatically — "applied it without asking", as the code itself put it — which
  cascaded into every power zone. Many riders find intervals.icu's eFTP unreliable,
  so this is now **off by default**. The drift is still detected and shown (with a
  banner and a manual "Accept" button), so you decide whether to apply it. If you
  *want* the old automatic behavior, opt in with `eftp_auto_apply: true` in your
  user preferences.

### Power & data

- **The power curve self-heals when efforts are missing.** Your peak power could
  read far too low (e.g. Pmax 693 W vs 1229 W on intervals.icu, with CP/W′ showing
  "—") because the backfill that pulls best-effort data only ran when the curve was
  completely empty — a few stale edge rides were enough to block it forever. It now
  triggers whenever in-window rides are missing their effort data, so the curve
  fills in correctly. (Full effect needs a working ICU connection — see TLS above.)

### Workout library

- **Removed an impossible "45 min in Z7" workout.** Two `anaerobic_ramp` files
  were corrupt staircases ramping to ~600% FTP. They slipped past the
  dangerous-workout screen because it treated anything with "ramp" in the name as a
  legitimate ramp *test*. The bad files are gone and the exemption is tightened to
  genuine FTP/ramp tests, so nothing physically impossible can be scheduled.
- **Workout scores are consistent everywhere.** The workout library and the
  `/api/workouts` view computed a workout's difficulty score from slightly
  different zone math for ramp segments, so the same file could score 5 in one
  place and 6 in another. Both now use identical ramp-aware zone accounting.

### Under the hood

- Added focused regression tests for every fix above (profiles, TLS, app relaunch,
  power-curve backfill, impossible-workout guard, volume ceiling, rest weeks, taper
  eve, eFTP opt-in, distribution choice, score consistency).
- Fixed a wellness test that depended on the developer's local data instead of
  isolating its fixture (no app behavior change — the TSB calculation was already
  correct).

### Still on the list (not in this release)

All reported **bugs** are fixed, and most of the original feedback (block
periodization, B/C races, honest zone-mixing library, outdoor realism, DFA α1
reliability, more variety) shipped above. Two items remain deliberately deferred:

- **Volume-scaled hard-day count** — capping hard sessions on low-volume weeks so
  they aren't intensity-dominated. Built and tested, but at realistic event volumes
  it conflicts with the planner's hard-type coverage rules: a typical build week's
  load only supports ~2 hard sessions, while the coverage rules want 3. Doing it
  right needs those rules made volume-aware (or the cap scoped to only genuinely
  low-volume weeks), so it's parked rather than shipped half-working.
- **Progression-based plan creator** — generating workouts from a progression model
  rather than picking from a fixed library. A larger project for a later release.

## v2.0.7 — Automatic week re-fit when you miss a hard session (2026-06-17)

When you skip a hard workout, the planner now automatically re-optimizes the rest
of that week instead of leaving stale easy days on the schedule. You skipped the
hard one, so you're fresher — the remaining days re-fit to make the most of it,
within the same injury-safety limits (never a "catch-up" pile-on).

### What changes for users

- **Miss a hard session → the rest of the week re-fits itself.** Before, a skipped
  hard day left the following recovery/easy days exactly as planned, and the missed
  work was only offered as a manual reschedule banner you had to accept. Now, on the
  next ride-sync or Plan-tab open, the planner re-optimizes every remaining *future*
  day of the current week and redistributes the missed stimulus where it fits.
- **Always within your safety limits.** The re-fit obeys the same guards as normal
  planning: no two hard days within 48h, the weekly hard-session cap, your
  availability, the polarized intensity mix, and per-type duration caps. If there's
  no safe room, the missed load is simply dropped — never crammed in as a
  back-to-back "catch-up" spike.
- **Only what changed moves.** A remaining day keeps its existing workout (and file)
  unless its type or duration actually changes — no surprise reshuffle of a session
  you already saw. Past days, completed rides, and anything you manually pinned are
  never touched. It runs once per missed-session episode, not on every sync.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Skip a hard day → rest of week unchanged; missed work only a manual banner | Skip a hard day → remaining week auto-re-fits, missed stimulus redistributed safely |
| Recovery day stays recovery even when you're fresh from skipping | A remaining day can absorb the work — bounded by 48h spacing / weekly HIT cap / ACWR |

## v2.0.6 — Plan reliability + honest workout labels (2026-06-17)

Five fixes to things that were quietly wrong: the plan freezing on open, hard
workouts landing on easy days, and workout names/charts that didn't match the
ride you'd actually do.

### What changes for users

- **Your plan no longer freezes while "catching up."** Opening the Plan tab runs
  a quick sync; a single ride whose heart-rate data couldn't be processed could
  block that sync for up to 45 seconds each — leaving the "catching up your plan"
  overlay spinning and, worse, silently skipping the step that reconciles a
  missed session. Sync can no longer stall the plan: that per-ride work is bounded
  and retried in the background, so a missed session now reliably reconciles and
  the rest of the week adapts.
- **Sprint / neuromuscular days are the right intensity again.** Workouts were
  typed by their *structure* (lots of short sprints) while ignoring total load, so
  ~29% of "neuromuscular" workouts were really threshold/anaerobic by intensity
  (IF 0.86–1.04) and landed on sprint days as ~140-TSS grinds. Sprint slots now
  reject over-cooked workouts (IF > 0.82), the sprint day-target reflects a true
  neuromuscular load instead of a near-threshold one, and the per-type duration
  cap is enforced on the reflow path too.
- **Recovery days stay easy.** A ramp from 50%→100% FTP was counted as if the
  whole segment sat at its *average* power, so a workout that spends a third of
  its time at threshold read as "95% easy" and could be placed on a recovery day.
  Ramp time is now spread across the zones it actually sweeps, so easy/recovery
  slots correctly screen hard workouts out.
- **Workout names tell the truth — everywhere.** 26% of the library carried a
  name whose type contradicted its content (a tempo workout labeled "Anaerobic",
  a threshold workout labeled "Neuromuscular"). All 4,198 names were regenerated
  from the actual workout, so the title is right in the app, in the downloaded
  ZWO/FIT, and on your Garmin / Wahoo / Hammerhead.
- **Power charts draw ramps the right way.** A descending ramp (e.g. 100%→50%)
  was drawn ascending, so a "ramp up, then down" workout showed as two ramps up.
  Charts now match the file and your head unit.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Plan tab could hang on "catching up"; missed session not reconciled | Sync can't block the plan; missed session reconciles + week adapts |
| ~29% of "neuromuscular" workouts were threshold-load (up to 142 TSS) | Sprint slots capped at IF ≤ 0.82 + true neuromuscular day-target |
| Ramp time mis-counted → hard workouts on recovery days | Ramp zones integrated → easy slots screen hard workouts out |
| 26% of names contradicted their content | 0% — every name matches the workout |
| Descending ramps drawn ascending | Ramps drawn in the authored direction |

## v2.0.4 — Planner safety + library injury cleanup (2026-06-15)

Two safety fixes — to how the plan is built, and to what's in the workout library —
plus workout names that finally tell the truth about the file.

### What changes for users

- **No more "VO2max every day."** The planner now guarantees two limits from the
  training-overload literature that previously weren't enforced end-to-end: a weekly
  cap on hard (HIT) sessions, and a per-type ceiling on how long a single hard session
  can run. A 2-hour weekday slot can no longer surface a 120-minute VO2max session, and
  no week exceeds its hard-session budget — regardless of goal or shuffle. The other
  guardrails (progressive ramp rate, recovery weeks, acute:chronic workload, 48-hour
  spacing between hard days) were already in place; these were the two gaps.
- **51 unsafe library workouts repaired.** A content screen found a small dangerous
  tail — corrupt power data (600% FTP ramps, 220% for 3 minutes), back-to-back max
  efforts with no recovery, and inadequate rest. These were amended in place into safe,
  functional workouts that keep their training intent (a sprint stays a sprint, just at
  an achievable wattage). Ramp tests and FTP tests are left untouched — those are
  legitimate maximal protocols, not hazards.
- **Workout names tell the truth.** After a workout's structure was amended, its in-app
  title, its in-file name/description, and its classification were all regenerated to
  match what the workout actually does now.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Up to a full week of VO2max; 120-min hard sessions | Within weekly HIT budget; each hard type duration-capped |
| 51 workouts with impossible / unsafe power | 0 dangerous workouts (whole-library re-scan) |
| "Anaerobic 5x2min (82min)" on a file holding 2×90s @ 150% | Name + description match the actual blocks |

## v2.0.3 — Windows: the actual launch fix (2026-06-14)

- **Windows: the app starts.** The previous release misdiagnosed the Windows launch
  failure as a missing pywebview/CLR backend. The real cause was simpler and
  unrelated: the launcher printed a status line containing a `→` character, which
  can't encode to the Windows console's legacy cp1252 codepage (`UnicodeEncodeError`),
  and in the windowed build `sys.stdout` is `None` so any `print()` raised regardless.
  Either path killed the launcher with an unhandled exception *before the window
  opened* — a silent "nothing happens" on Windows. The server itself was starting
  fine the whole time (`[db] Background sync completed` in the captured logs). Fixed
  by hardening stdout/stderr at startup — UTF-8 with `errors="replace"`, and `None`
  streams routed to a discard — so no status line can ever crash the process. No-op
  on macOS/Linux (already UTF-8).
- **The CI smoke-test now actually names the cause.** The Windows boot test captures
  the frozen app's real traceback (OS-level `cmd` output redirect + an on-disk crash
  dump, and it dumps *before* failing the step) instead of coming back blank — this
  is how the one-character bug above was finally pinned.
- **Leaner macOS entitlements (three → one).** Dropped `disable-library-validation`
  (redundant — `build_dmg.sh` re-signs every bundled Mach-O with our Developer ID, so
  all carry our Team ID and library validation passes on its own) and
  `allow-dyld-environment-variables` (unused — PyInstaller resolves via `@rpath`). Only
  `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` remains, and it's genuinely required: the embedded
  WebKit/pyobjc GUI allocates executable memory under the hardened runtime.
- **Planner: determinism + event-aware consistency + variety.**
  - *Deterministic generation* — a cold-cache read in the interval-floor pass desynced
    the per-week RNG on the first plan built in a process, so that plan differed from
    later ones (and a regenerate could drift). Plans are now byte-identical across calls
    for a given seed.
  - *Over-under sessions reliably appear* in the build phases — they had no hard-floor
    and only a floor-level mix weight, so unlucky seeds dropped them entirely.
  - *Event targets now reach `recalculate_plan`* (and route through the content-aware
    sampler), so a weekly recalc for an event goal keeps the long-ride progression and
    mix emphasis instead of reverting to a generic skeleton.
  - *Weekly tier-down* only touches today-onward hards (never re-touches a session you
    already rode), and the long-ride ramp no longer resets to the floor on a mid-plan
    regenerate.
  - *Steady-slot interval variety* is now drawn only from classes honest at tempo
    intensity, so an easy day is never a hard interval wearing an "easy" label.

## v2.0.2 — Windows launch fix, polarization label, CI smoke-test (2026-06-14)

- **Windows: the app starts again.** The frozen Windows build couldn't initialise
  its window — pywebview's EdgeChromium/WinForms backend and its `pythonnet`/`clr`
  bridge were missing from the package, so it failed silently with no console.
  Added the backend + `pythonnet` (Windows-only) to the build, made launch failures
  visible (logged + a message box), and hardened the browser fallback.
- **Polarization label now matches intervals.icu.** A ride could read "Unique" in
  Domestique while intervals.icu called it "Polarized" — the classifier evaluated an
  *additive* polarization index while the card displayed the *multiplicative* Treff
  index. Both now use one Treff-PI source of truth, so a polarized ride is labelled
  polarized (every documented reference distribution keeps its label).
- **Windows CI smoke-test.** Every release now boots the built Windows `.exe`
  headless and asserts it serves the correct version — a Windows-launch regression
  fails the build instead of reaching users (mirrors the macOS version smoke-test).

## v2.0.1 — bugfixes: power curve, faster library load, catch-up hang (2026-06-14)

- **Power curve renders again** on the home screen. It was blank for riders whose
  cached intervals.icu rides carried no power efforts and had no path to hydrate
  them. The endpoint now self-heals (fetches the missing power streams on demand)
  and excludes running activities, whose estimated watts were polluting the curve.
- **Workout library loads ~16× faster** — a prebuilt `.library_index.json` cuts the
  first plan/library load from ~3 s to ~0.2 s. No behaviour change: the indexed rows
  are identical to the live ZWO parse, and the index self-heals if the library changes.
- **"Catching up your plan" can no longer hang.** Each step now races a 40 s timeout;
  on a stall it shows an error with Close / Retry instead of spinning forever.
- **Loading bars** replace spinners on the catch-up overlay and the library load.
- Release builds now run a version smoke-test (the bundled app must report its own
  version) so a mis-bundled build can't ship.

## v2.0.0 — goal-aware selection + event-driven planning (2026-06-13)

The planner now adapts what it schedules to *what you're training for* — both the
focus (raise FTP vs VO2max) and the target event (its distance + elevation).

### Goal-aware workout selection
- **FTP focus** schedules more threshold + sweet-spot + over-under work; **VO2max
  focus** schedules more VO2max / Rønnestad-30-15 work; **hybrid** blends both. The
  evidence-based protocols added in v1.10.0 now actually come up more often for the
  matching goal (previously the mix was the same regardless of focus). Grounded in
  the PubMed FTP/LT review (threshold 4×8 @100–105% is the #1 FTP driver, then VO2).

### Event-driven training plan
When your goal is a target event, the plan is now built from what the event
*demands* instead of a generic curve:
- **Demand model** (existing physics, now wired into the plan): distance + elevation
  + your FTP/weight → predicted finish time, event TSS, climbing demand.
- **Long-ride progression** — the headline: the weekend long ride grows from your
  current longest toward ~0.8× event duration (+25 min/week), honestly capped by
  your weekend hours and a 5 h ceiling, and stops ≥3 weeks out so the taper owns it.
  A 100 km/500 m and a 175 km/2900 m fondo now produce visibly different plans.
- **Feasibility-bounded fitness target** — the CTL target is the event-type band
  nudged by event difficulty, then capped by what's reachable in the weeks you have
  (TrainingPeaks-ATP-style): the goal is lowered automatically if the date is too
  soon, rather than prescribing an impossible ramp.
- **Climbing specificity** — a climby route (>12 m gained/km) biases build + peak
  toward sustained threshold / over-under / sustained-VO₂ work, away from punchy
  sprints. Phase-gated to build/peak only.
- Survives auto-sync: the event targets are applied on initial generation **and** on
  every regenerate/reconcile, so the plan doesn't revert.
- Non-event and non-focus goals are unchanged.

Method triangulated across PubMed (demand + durability), platform/coach practice
(TrainingPeaks ATP, Friel, intervals.icu, WKO5/Xert), and an adversarial design grill.

## v1.10.0 — evidence-based library overhaul, filter redesign, planner fixes (2026-06-13)

A research-driven pass over the workout library plus a cleaner library browser
and three planner-quality fixes.

### Library — evidence-based interval work (PubMed)
- **Added the canonical Rønnestad protocols** the library was missing: short
  intervals (3 series × 13 × 30/15 s, 3 min between series), long intervals
  (4–5 × 5 min, 2.5 min between), proper Wingate-style **SIT** (30 s all-out @
  150–170% FTP with a full **4-min** recovery), and descending VO₂ ladders
  (5-4-3-2-1 min). Every addition is classify-before-write + structure-deduped.
- **Removed 18 under-rested anaerobic files** — all-out efforts (≥130% FTP,
  20–60 s) with **under 2 min** recovery, which is the "rest is too short"
  problem reported on the old library. The evidence (Buchheit & Laursen) is
  ≥2 min for repeatable maximal quality; corrected versions now exist.
- **Renamed 282 mis-named files** to match their actual content: a workout the
  classifier reads as `threshold` is now named `threshold_*`, not `vo2max_*`.
  (match_zwo already selected on content, so prescriptions were never wrong —
  this fixes only the confusing filenames.) Net library change: 4178 → 4198.

### Library browser — filter redesign
- **One unified Type** filter (the 16-class content classifier, optgroup-grouped)
  replaces the old duplicate Type + Content-class selects.
- **Duration goes to 180 min** (the long endurance rides were previously
  unreachable past 120), with live min/max sliders + number boxes.
- **Min Score · Surface · Tags** moved into an **Advanced** disclosure, so the
  default bar is just Type · Duration · Search · Sort.

### Planner quality
- **Easy slots stay easy**: Z2 / recovery / long-Z2 slots now reject workouts
  with embedded threshold / VO₂ / sprint content (no more a "VO₂ 6×2 min"
  landing in an endurance day).
- **Reshuffle never gets stuck**: re-rolling a workout now hard-excludes prior
  picks, persists the exclusion across reopen, and wraps when the pool is
  exhausted (with a clear "start over" affordance).
- **Availability is capped at 6 h/session** so a typo (e.g. 10 h) can't spawn an
  absurd session; realistic hours still apply literally.

## v1.9.1 — FIT import: drag-and-drop + instant refresh (2026-06-13)

- **Drag-and-drop a `.fit`**: drag a ride file from Finder anywhere onto the app
  window and a drop overlay appears — release to import. (The header
  **Import FIT** button still works too.) Only file drags trigger it, so the
  calendar's drag-to-move is untouched.
- **Imports now refresh on the spot**: after an import the This Week card, plan
  grid and home metrics repaint immediately, reflecting the ride and the plan
  auto-adapt it triggers (reconcile + load adjustment). Previously the import
  persisted silently and you had to reload to see anything.

## v1.9.0 — onboarding + "This Week" overhaul, automatic reconcile, bigger library (2026-06-13)

A batch of UX + correctness work across first-run, the home "This Week" card,
workout selection, and the library.

### Onboarding — first-run wizard reworked
- **Account guidance**: a true new user is no longer assumed to already have an
  Intervals.icu account — the wizard now says it's free and you can sign in with
  Garmin or Strava, with a direct signup link.
- **One field, auto-detected**: paste your API key and the athlete ID is detected
  for you (manual entry demoted to Advanced).
- **Can't proceed on a bad key**: the connection is auto-tested on paste and
  "Next" stays disabled until it's green (editing the key re-arms the gate).
- **Garmin verify**: a "Check sync" button asks Intervals.icu whether your
  activities are actually flowing (and how many are from Garmin) — honest, not a
  blind "looks linked".
- **Skippable** ("I'll import FIT files manually"), 5 steps → 4, precise API-key
  directions, and wizard state survives a refresh (secrets never persisted).

### "This Week" — accuracy fixes (it was quietly telling you you're behind)
- **Every ride counts**: a second ride on a day (commute + trainer) now adds to
  the week's actual load — previously only the longest ride counted, so any
  2-ride day under-read the on-track bar, compliance band and completion %.
- **Completed ≠ failed**: a finished ride that arrived without a TSS number no
  longer renders a red "failed" cell — it's neutral (done, just no load value).
- **Automatic reconcile**: matching completed rides to planned sessions
  (done / missed / ambiguous) now happens automatically on every ride sync, as
  part of the plan's auto-adapt — no manual step. The **Reconcile Week** button
  is gone.
- **"Catching up your plan"**: opening the Plan tab shows a visible checklist —
  reads what was prescribed, reconciles what you did, checks recovery (Garmin
  HRV), and adapts the plan — instead of doing it silently.
- Removed the redundant **Refresh** button (Sync now already redraws).

### Workout selection — match_zwo brought in line with the planner
- z2 / recovery slots no longer pull a tempo/sweet-spot-finisher workout that
  would over-cook an easy day (hard grey-zone gate).
- Selection now buckets on the canonical content class (not the older protocol
  zone-heuristic), and low-intensity endurance / recovery files are reachable on
  reshuffle again (a duration-guarded score floor).

### Library — bigger + cleaner
- Grown to **4 178** clean, copyright-free canonical workouts via the
  classify-before-write pipeline: comprehensive Z2/endurance structure variety
  (steady, two-zone, progressive, surges), long-aerobic coverage to 3 h, and
  finer duration granularity across all classes. Pruned 22 ramp-only files that
  weren't real sessions.

## v1.8.24 — smarter plan updates + exact-duration reshuffle (2026-06-11)

Streamlined the training-plan controls and made the plan adapt to missed
workouts on its own, plus a reshuffle that respects the slot's duration.

### One "Update plan" button (was: Reforecast / Regenerate / two silent triggers)

The plan tab had too many overlapping controls. Consolidated to a single
primary **Update plan** action that automatically does the right thing:

- on track → a structure-preserving **rebalance** to today's TSB (fatigue),
  ACWR (load ratio) and availability;
- behind plan → a full **rebuild with a recovery ramp** (Gabbett ACWR < 1.3,
  Z2 reconditioning — never a catch-up load spike on a detrained rider).

The old standalone "Reforecast" is folded into Update plan; "Regenerate" is now
the advanced **Rebuild from scratch** (force-rebuild). Per-day **Rematch** and
the availability **UPDATE** button are unchanged. Auto-adjustments are no longer
silent — a status line shows what changed ("Plan rebuilt: 3-week recovery ramp —
you missed 2 weeks" / "Plan rebalanced to today's fitness").

### Auto-rebuild after missed workouts

Missing training makes you *fresher* (higher TSB, lower CTL), so the old
overshoot-only reforecast never reacted — the plan went stale after missed
weeks. Now a ride sync that detects a significant **current** absence rebuilds
automatically through the recovery ramp. Safeguards:

- a **per-absence-episode latch** so it rebuilds **once** per gap, not on every
  sync (no repeated future-workout reshuffles);
- a **recent-gap gate** so an old, already-recovered gap never nags;
- an **event-taper guard** — within ~3 weeks of an event it will not silently
  recompute your taper; it flags "behind plan" and leaves the decision to you;
- past/completed sessions are never re-rolled, and a fixed event date never
  moves.

### Reshuffle keeps the duration

"Rematch/reshuffle" could return a workout far from the slot's length (a 90-min
slot → a 45-min file) because the score-weighted pick could surface a
far-duration file. Reshuffle now collapses to the **closest available duration**
before picking, so a 90-min slot stays ~90 min (exact when the library has it)
and never returns a wildly different length. Plan generation is unchanged.

## v1.8.23 — more polarized workouts + Rønnestad VO2 blocks + duration coverage (2026-06-10)

Added **+227 clean canonical workouts** (library 3260 → 3487), all generated
through the classify-before-write pipeline (every file run through the live
content classifier and kept only if its type + title + duration match — zero
mislabels, zero brand names, zero duration mismatches across the whole library).

### Polarized emphasis (the ask)

New **macro-block / Rønnestad-style** VO2 sessions: hard VO2 work (110–118% FTP)
with **easy Z1/low-Z2 recovery (~50%) between every rep AND between blocks** — no
tempo/threshold grey-zone filler. E.g. "VO2 Short 40min — 10×30s/15s @ 118%" run
as 3 macro blocks separated by 3-min @50% easy spins. Classic 30/15, 40/20,
30/30, and 1-min / 2-min / 3-min on-with-equal-easy-recovery variants, plus the
4×(1min hard / easy) ×3-block structure. These land as vo2max / vo2_short and
span 30/45/60/75/90 min.

### Duration coverage

Filled 30/45/60/75/90-min cells across the aerobic classes (endurance, tempo,
tempo_intervals, sweet_spot, threshold) and the polarized VO2 family. High-
intensity classes (anaerobic, neuromuscular) stay intentionally thin at 75–90
min — sustained 90-min anaerobic isn't physiological; the polarized VO2 blocks
are how long sessions stay hard-but-sound.

All workouts are `<author>Domestique Library</author>`, content-derived generic
names, round durations + round power %, deduped against the existing library.
match_zwo no-ghost invariant + DFA suites green.


## v1.8.22 — Expanded workout library (+206 clean canonical workouts) (2026-06-10)

Added 206 new structured workouts (3054 → 3260), all procedurally generated by
`scripts/generate_clean_workouts.py` — copyright-clean, authored locally, named
from their own content. Targets the canonical-design quality the existing
library was thin on: round total durations, round power %, canonical interval
sets, sensible recovery ratios, proper warmup/cooldown ramps — across the
gap cells (long endurance/tempo/sweet-spot/threshold, short VO2/anaerobic,
over-unders, neuromuscular sprints).

Every generated file passes a **classify-before-write** gate: it's run through
the live content classifier and kept ONLY if its detected class matches the
intended class, its title's reps/duration match the content exactly, and its
total lands on a round boundary. Intervals are emitted as `<IntervalsT>` so rep
counts are exact. Result, verified across the WHOLE 3260-file library:

- **0** titles with a non-generic / brand token
- **0** title-vs-actual-duration mismatches
- **0** off-round durations or non-round power targets in the new files
- **0** misclassified candidates shipped (classify-before-write rejected the few that drifted)
- ZWO/FIT parity holds (the v1.8.17 ramp staircase transcodes the new ramps correctly)
- `match_zwo` still only ever emits real library files (invariant test green)

Existing workouts untouched (additive). Design spec adversarially grilled before
generation — the grill caught 4 classification/duration/naming traps by running
candidate structures through the live classifier, all fixed before any file was
written.

Also folds in the v1.8.21 fixes (availability calendar repopulates on generate;
hard per-day session-duration clamp; wider library duration filter fields).

## v1.8.21 — generating a plan with new hours now fills the availability calendar (2026-06-10)

Generating a new plan with different weekday/weekend hours shaped the plan
correctly but left the **availability calendar** showing the OLD per-day hours.

Root cause: the availability calendar is dense (every day has an entry), and
`/api/plan/generate` carried the previous `plan["availability"]` over verbatim
(a v1.3.2 "don't wipe the calendar" guard). The frontend only fills weekly-grid
defaults for days NOT already present — so with every day already present (stale),
the new hours never reached the calendar.

Fix: on generate, the per-day calendar is rebuilt from the newly chosen weekly
hours (`daily_availability` per weekday, else max_weekday/weekend, rest days → 0)
across the whole plan span, while **explicit user blocks (holiday / injury /
illness / unavailable) are preserved**. So changing your hours now updates the
whole month's calendar, and your marked holidays survive.

Verified: weekday slots → new weekday hours, weekend → new weekend hours, holiday
preserved, no stale entries remain. New regression test.

### Sessions never exceed your available time (hard duration clamp)

A 90-min availability still produced 99–115-min weekday sessions, and (when the
weekend was left at the 3.5h default) 2.5h weekend sessions. The sampler's
feasibility window admits a workout file up to ~25 min over the slot for pool
breadth, and the file's full duration became the session duration. Added an
authoritative final clamp in `generate_plan`: every non-rest session is capped
to its day's effective availability (per-date calendar override if set, else the
per-weekday max), TSS scaled proportionally. The matched ZWO may be slightly
longer and is paced on the trainer (the modal's showGap banner explains it). To
cap weekends too, set the weekend hours — the clamp is per-day.

### Library duration filter — number fields widened

The min/max number inputs in the Workout-Library duration filter were 48px and
clipped "90" to "9". Widened to 64px with a min-width so 2–3 digit values fit.

## v1.8.20 — stop auto-regen wiping your edits + availability; library shows canonical names (2026-06-07)

Two fixes, both planned and **adversarially grilled** (the grills caught a
missed dataclass field, a future-week edge, and a search-vs-display mismatch
before any code shipped).

### A — `/api/plan/regenerate` no longer destroys user edits or the availability calendar (HIGH severity)

This endpoint **auto-fires** (no click) when you fall ≥2 weeks behind and open
the Plan tab. It was silently wiping data on every fire because it round-tripped
only 8 of `PlannedSession`'s 22 fields and rebuilt the plan from a fixed key set
— dropping `user_moved` / `status` / `moved_from` / `completion_matches` /
`dismissed_at` / `adapted` / `am_or_pm`, AND the top-level **availability
calendar** + `reforecast_date` + `last_reforecast_info`.

Fixes:
- New canonical `_planned_session_from_json` / `_planned_session_to_json` helpers
  that derive the field list from `dataclasses.fields(PlannedSession)` (so no
  field can ever silently regress) and pass through the two JSON-only keys
  (`variation`, `adapted_reason`). `_load_current_week_dto` now routes through
  them too — single source of truth.
- The regenerate endpoint reconstructs + serializes via the helpers, and builds
  the new plan by **copying the original** and overlaying only the regenerated
  weeks/phases — so availability + every other top-level key survive.
- `regenerate_from_today` now gathers preserved (dismissed / user-moved /
  completed) sessions from the **current and all future weeks**, not just the
  current week — a future-dated dismissal was being re-prescribed on every
  regen. (A genuine ≥2-week absence still rebuilds the future via the recovery
  ramp — that legitimately supersedes future edits; a routine regen preserves
  them.)

### B — Library + Workout-Shuffle titles show the canonical name, not the legacy ZWO `<name>` tag

Every library/picker/detail title rendered the ZWO `<name>` tag, which disagrees
with the content-classified `display_name` for **100% of 3054 files** — and
names the WRONG protocol for ~50% (a file the planner calls "Over-Unders 63min"
showed "Anaerobic 10s/10s 12x" in the library). `/api/workouts` and
`/api/workout/<cat>/<file>` now emit `display_name`; the three title surfaces
render `display_name` with a `|| Name` fallback; server-side search also matches
`display_name` so typing the visible title returns hits. Power-profile charts +
durations were already consistent (v1.8.17).

New `test_v1820_regen_preserves.py` (endpoint top-level-key survival + a
function-level gather-broadening proof). Plan/calendar/regen suites green.

## v1.8.19 — workout match honours the planned duration much more tightly (2026-06-07)

Follow-up to v1.8.18. The plan matcher (`match_zwo`) used a loose flat duration
gate (±40 min, ±60 for long rides) plus a gentle absolute proximity penalty, so
an 82-min slot could resolve to a 120-min file and a 120-min slot to a 175-min
file — and the score-weighted random pick still surfaced those far files.

Two changes:
- **Hard gate is now relative**: ±25% of the target (floor 15 min) instead of a
  flat ±40/±60, bounding the worst-case mismatch to ~a quarter of the slot.
- **Proximity penalty is now relative** (gap as a fraction of target × 14) so it
  reliably outweighs the category bonus once the gap is large.

Measured on representative slots: mean |planned − file| duration dropped from
**18.6 → 10.7 min**, worst case **55 → 24 min**, with no empty matches and the
v4.5.0 variety acceptance (≥150 distinct ZWOs, top-5 ≤15%) preserved. Applies to
new generation + future heals; already-resolved sessions are left untouched (no
churn). Planner diversification / utilization / interval-variety suites green.

### Reforecast undershoot — investigated, NOT auto-changed (deliberate)

Investigated whether missed/easier weeks auto-rebalance the future plan. Findings:
big gaps (≥2 consecutive missed weeks or CTL drop >15) DO auto-regenerate on
Plan-tab open via a **safe recovery ramp** (ACWR<1.3 cap, Z2 reconditioning);
minor undershoot correctly self-absorbs via the CTL recompute. A proposed
auto-escalation on ride-sync was designed, **adversarially grilled, and
rejected**: it would have amplified a pre-existing data-loss bug (the auto-regen
path silently drops `user_moved` / `status` / `dismissed_at` / the availability
calendar) and run an undebounced full rebuild in the sync response. Tracked as a
separate fix (repair regen field-preservation first, then escalation).

## v1.8.18 — plan zwo_file reference integrity (heal 77 ghost references; freeze training history) (2026-06-07)

The active plan stored `zwo_file` values that don't exist in the local
`workouts/` library — **124 of 147 sessions** (120 external Zwift/TR plan
slugs like `ftp-builder/week-6-day-3.zwo` + 4 flat-missing). Those sessions
404'd on read and fell back to a synthetic generic chart — the root cause of
the "60min slot → 25min chart" + the synthetic ZWO/FIT divergence.

Investigated with two Wave-0 agents, planned, and **adversarially grilled
before any write** (this rewrites a real training plan). The grill caught three
data-corruption blockers the first design would have shipped:

1. **Freeze the past.** 47 of the bad sessions are *past-dated* — healing them
   would silently rewrite training *history*. The migration now skips any
   session before today; only the 77 future sessions are re-resolved.
2. **Deterministic anchor.** The healer read `plan["generated_at"]` but the key
   is `generated`, so the `match_zwo` seed fell back to `date.today()` and
   drifted daily → a re-matched session re-rolled to a different file on every
   launch. Now reads the plan's stable `generated` date → no churn.
3. **Resolves-on-disk staleness.** The old test was session_type↔filename
   *prefix*, which re-flagged `match_zwo`'s legitimate fallback matches
   (sweetspot→over_under) forever (infinite re-heal). Replaced with a pure
   existence check: stale iff the path has a separator OR the basename isn't in
   the library.

The heal is idempotent (verified: pass 2 rewrites 0), writes a one-time
`.premigration-v1818` snapshot before the first mutation, and clears any
truly-unmatchable ghost to an honest empty (synthesised) rather than a 404.

On the live plan: 77 future ghosts → real local files, 47 past frozen
byte-identical, second pass a no-op. New `test_v1818_plan_zwo_integrity.py`
(4 tests) + updated staleness tests; planner suites green.

Note (separate follow-up): match_zwo's duration *tightness* (an 82min slot can
still resolve to a 45min file within its ±40min gate) and the reforecast
*undershoot* gap (missed/easier weeks don't auto-rebalance future days) are
known and tracked separately — not in this release.

## v1.8.17 — FIT ramps no longer flatten (ZWO≡FIT), workout-duration honesty, single What's-new arrow (2026-06-07)

### ZWO and FIT are now the same workout (ramp fix)

A downloaded ZWO and FIT of the *same* workout looked completely different on
the trainer: the ZWO showed diagonal sawtooth ramps, the FIT showed flat
blocks. Verified against the user's two actual downloads
(`neuromuscular_4x10s_61min.zwo`/`.fit`): both 61.0 min, identical sprints +
tempo blocks — the *only* difference was the ZWO's six `<Ramp>` segments
(0.65→1.05) collapsing to a single flat step at their **average** (0.85) in the
FIT, because FIT workout steps have no native power ramp.

Fix: `_build_fit_workout_from_zwo` now **staircases** every Warmup / Ramp /
Cooldown into ~30 s sub-steps that step linearly from PowerLow to PowerHigh, so
the FIT power profile matches the ZWO ramp shape. Total duration is conserved
exactly. **83% of the 3054-workout library (2564 files) contain ramp/warmup/
cooldown elements that were being flattened** — all fixed.

### Workout duration shown is the matched file, not the planned slot

The session modal titled a workout by the planner's *slot* duration (e.g.
"(60min)") while the matched workout — and its chart — were 25 min. The hero
title AND the big Duration stat now reflect the matched file's real duration;
the plan-vs-file gap stays surfaced by the existing advisory banner.

### Single "What's new" arrow

The update-banner disclosure showed two arrows (a manual chevron + the native
WebKit triangle that `display:inline-block` re-enabled). Now one chevron that
rotates on open; the native marker is suppressed per-element.

### Known follow-up (not in this release)

Scan of the active plan found **125 of 147 sessions reference a `zwo_file` that
doesn't exist** in the local `workouts/` dir (external Zwift/TR plan
subdirectory names). Those sessions fall back to a synthetic generic shape
(the "60min slot → 25min chart" case). Fixing plan→file reference integrity is
a separate backend task.

## v1.8.16 — readiness downgrade rules respect recency + form; library duration slider UX (2026-06-06)

### Auto-downgrade fired on a 5-day-old ride while the rider was fresh

The home banner downgraded today's HARD session to Z2 citing "aerobic fatigue"
from a ride **5 days ago**, while every other signal said FRESH: TSB **+17**,
readiness **78/GOOD**, DFA α1 **healthy (1.126)**. Root causes + fixes (planned,
adversarially grilled before code — this alters training prescription):

1. **No recency gate.** `check_aerobic_decoupling` fired on the most-recent ride
   that *had* a decoupling value — 5 days stale here (later rides had none). Now
   gated to ≤2 days; known-stale readings are dropped.
2. **No form cross-check.** The weak decoupling signal ignored the app's own load
   model. Now vetoed when form is fresh (TSB ≥ +5 **or** readiness GOOD/EXCELLENT)
   **AND** DFA independently corroborates freshness. Critically, when DFA is
   *absent* (most rides have no RR), the advisory is **kept** — TSB lags acute
   fatigue ~7 d, so a fresh TSB alone is not grounds to silence the only signal.
3. **The STRONG DFA α1 cap is never form-vetoed** (acute autonomic stress can
   coexist with a fresh TSB) — only recency-gated on the newest DFA ride (≤2 d),
   and kept when the date is unknown (fail-safe). Regression test proves a
   collapsing α1 still caps even at TSB +20 / EXCELLENT.
4. **Banner truthfulness.** Decoupling is advisory-only in the planner (only the
   DFA cap / injury gates actually swap the session). The banner now says
   "Z2 recommended (advisory — not enforced)" for decoupling, and only
   "auto-downgraded to Z2" when a real downgrade was applied.

### Workout-library duration slider

- Added typeable **min/max number fields** alongside the sliders.
- Dragging a knob past the other now **clamps** at the boundary instead of
  swapping the two values (the swap made the other slider's number jump).
- The expensive library re-filter runs only on **release** (`change`); dragging
  updates just the label + paired box live — no more per-pixel reloads / lag.

13 new tests (downgrade gating + the no-veto-leak regression). Fixed two stale
2-tuple `_recent_dfa_and_decoupling` mocks (now 4-tuple) that were red since the
v1.8.15 signature change.

## v1.8.15 — update banner no longer shows a phantom old version; readiness advisory names the real ride day (2026-06-03)

### 1. "Update available — v1.8.9 → v1.8.14" on an already-updated app

`/api/update/check` cached the **running app's own version** (`current`) for
6 h alongside the GitHub `latest` lookup. After updating (e.g. 1.8.9 → 1.8.14)
and relaunching, a cache hit within the TTL replayed the OLD `current`, so the
banner claimed an update was still pending — the app looked like it hadn't
updated even though the new binary was running.

Fix (two layers):
1. **Version-mismatch invalidation** — the cache stores `current` = the app
   version that wrote it. `_cache_is_fresh` now returns False when that ≠ the
   live `_VERSION`, so a cache written by a *prior install* is discarded and
   the endpoint refetches everything (latest, release notes, the lot). This is
   the "cache updates after a new installation" fix.
2. **Live-current overlay** — as a belt-and-suspenders second layer, `current`
   + `update_available` are also recomputed from the live `_VERSION` on every
   served response (cache hit / miss / error fallback). Only GitHub-derived
   fields (`latest`, `release_url`, `download_url`, `release_body`) are cached.

### 2. Readiness advisory said "Yesterday's ride" when the ride was 2 days ago

NOT a date-indexing error — the ride was correctly stored (e.g. 2026-06-01,
2 days before today). The banner literally hardcoded the word "Yesterday's
ride" with **zero date logic**. The trigger ride is the most recent *indexed*
ride with a decoupling value — often 2+ days back when the prior day was a
rest day. The endpoint now returns `decoupling_advisory_date` (the real
source-ride date), and the banner computes "Today's ride" / "Yesterday's ride"
/ "Your ride N days ago (Mon Jun 1)" accordingly.

Also fixed: the session-type fallback produced "THE PLANNED HARD SESSION
session" (double word, shouty placeholder). The fallback is now a single bare
word so it reads "Today's HARD session has been auto-downgraded to Z2."


## v1.8.14 — DFA α1: artifact fix + HRVT1/HRVT2 zones + intensity distribution + DFA tab (2026-06-01)

A validation pass on real ride data found the DFA α1 numbers were
computed **incorrectly** (no artifact rejection). Fixed, then built the
threshold/zone feature on top: HRVT1/HRVT2 (aerobic + anaerobic
thresholds as HR + power), 3-zone intensity distribution, a dedicated
**DFA α1 tab** (aggregate↔per-ride toggle, r²-graded), and the per-ride
α1-over-time chart in the activity modal. Researched against primary
literature (8 PMC/PMID papers, now in README + docs/SCIENCE_REVIEW.md).
Shipped through the structured plan→grill→implement flow
(`/tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_v1814_dfa_indexing.md`); the grill caught a
migration blocker + contract drift before they shipped.

### HRVT1 / HRVT2 thresholds + DFA zones (new, beta)

α1=0.75 → HRVT1 (aerobic threshold, VT1/LT1, top of Zone 2); α1=0.50 →
HRVT2 (anaerobic threshold, VT2/LT2). Detected by regressing α1 on HR
and power across a ride's 120 s/30 s windows and interpolating the
crossing; aggregated as a recent median (r²≥0.50). Cycling validation:
HRVT1 ICC 0.77 / r 0.81; **HRVT2 power ICC 0.97, r 0.92–0.93** (power is
the better anchor — HR HRVT2 is unreliable and omitted). Complements
FTP: FTP anchors ~LT2, DFA adds the LT1 / Zone-2 ceiling FTP can't give,
HR-zones with no power meter. Thresholds only resolve on rides that
**sweep through** them (ramp/progressive) — steady rides correctly show
"no threshold crossed". Per-ride r² shown + color-graded; zones are
display-only (never overwrite configured FTP/zones). Labelled beta
(day-to-day reproducibility unproven; Cassirame 2025 critique; hysteresis
not corrected).

### 3-zone intensity distribution

Per ride: minutes with α1>0.75 (Z1 easy) / 0.50–0.75 (Z2 moderate) /
<0.50 (Z3 hard), over valid α1 windows. Shown as a per-ride bar
(normalised to analysed time, not ride length).

### DFA α1 tab

Aggregate view (estimated HRVT1/HRVT2 HR+power zones + 3-zone model) ↔
per-ride table (date, duration, HR, α1, Z1·Z2·Z3 bar, HRVT1/HRVT2 with
per-channel r² color + (i) tooltip). Click a row → that ride's α1 curve.
On first open after the algorithm bump, a one-time **version-migration
backfill** recomputes existing `computed` rides into algo v3 (so the tab
isn't empty); throttled, with progress UI.

### Indexing

DFA is computed once at ICU-sync augment time and stored per-ride
(`dfa_alpha1_*`, `dfa_hrvt1/2`, `dfa_zone_minutes`, `dfa_algo_version=3`).
The tab/aggregate scan stored envelopes on read — no stream re-fetch.
`dfa_algo_version` gates recompute so an algorithm change self-heals via
the migrate backfill instead of leaving stale values.

### The bug: missing RR-artifact rejection

DFA α1 is computed from beat-to-beat RR intervals and is acutely
sensitive to artifacts (ectopic / missed / inserted beats). The pipeline
filtered only 0-ms and 65535-ms sentinels — no ectopic rejection. On a
real ride that meant ~1.3 % corrupt beats dragged α1 from a
physiologically-correct **1.16** down to **0.573** (which would imply the
rider spent a 63-min ride entirely above anaerobic threshold —
impossible) AND silently rejected 57 of 72 windows via the R²-fit gate,
wrecking the per-window series and the LT1-minutes count.

Fix: a **Malik (1996) 20 % relative filter** (the Kubios / Rogers 2021 /
Gronwald 2020 standard) at the single chokepoint both compute paths route
through (`analytics.compute_dfa_alpha1`). Validated across 5–20 %
thresholds — stable. Synthetic white/pink/Brownian golden tests still
pass (the filter doesn't distort clean signals).

Before → after on the maintainer's three HRV rides:

| date | ride | avg HR | α1 before | α1 after | windows before→after |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-23 | Zwolle 63 min | 144 | 0.573 | **1.162** | 15 → 72 |
| 2026-05-21 | Zwolle 219 min | 160 | (timeout) | **0.992** | — → 143 |
| 2026-05-19 | Zwolle 98 min | 142 | 1.032 | **1.063** | 31 → 114 |

### Auto-recompute of stale values

Added a `dfa_algo_version` stamp (now `2`). Records computed by an older
algorithm are no longer treated as sticky, so they recompute on the next
sync / backfill — existing rides self-heal to the corrected values with
no user action and no forced backfill.

### HRV indexing — verified correct

Confirmed the RR stream is parsed/aligned correctly against two
independent ground truths: parsed beat count = 96.6–96.7 % of
(avg HR × duration), and Σ(RR) = 97.6–98.2 % of wall-clock ride time.
ICU `hrv`-stream slots align 1:1 with the time + HR channels. The two
recent **runs** that showed "no HRV" genuinely have no RR channel from
the device — correctly reported as `no_rr_data`, not a bug.

### In-app DFA α1 chart

The per-window α1 series was computed and stored but never charted — the
app only showed the scalar average. The activity-detail modal now draws
the **α1-over-time curve** on a fixed 0.3–1.6 axis with the 0.75 LT1 and
0.5 anaerobic reference lines, points coloured by zone (green aerobic /
amber threshold / red high-intensity), plus a "N min below 0.75 (LT1)"
readout. Pure inline SVG, no chart library.

### Tests

`test_dfa_alpha1` +4 (artifact filter: spike-drop, no-cascade,
empty/singleton, corrupt-series-recovers); `test_v1810_dfa_backfill` +1
(stale-version recompute) and updated the sticky test for the version
gate. Full DFA + backfill suites green.

## v1.8.13 — new activities auto-push to the calendars + explicit Refresh buttons (2026-06-01)

New rides now appear on the calendars on their own, and there's a
dedicated Refresh button in both the This Week strip and the Plan tab.

### Auto-push (no clicks)

The 60-second sync-health poll already hit `/api/sync/status` (which
reports `activity_records`, the row count in the activities table) —
but it only painted the error banner. It never noticed when a NEW ride
had landed server-side (boot auto-sync, lazy sync-on-read, or the
30-min background sync), so the ride sat invisible until the user
manually clicked Sync.

Now the poll tracks `activity_records` across ticks. When the count
rises, it repaints `loadCalendar()` + `loadWeeklyCalendar()` (and
`loadPlan()` if the Plan tab is the active section) and shows a
"N new activities synced — calendar updated" toast. First poll just
seeds the baseline so there's no false toast on load. The auto-push
runs even when the error banner is dismissed — dismissing the banner
must never disable refresh.

### Explicit Refresh button

Added a **Refresh ↻** button next to the existing **Sync now ⟳** in
both the This Week header and the Plan tab header. The distinction:

- **Sync now** — force-pulls from intervals.icu (bypasses the throttle,
  waits on the network round-trip).
- **Refresh** — re-renders the calendars + plan grid from
  already-synced data. `/api/calendar` still does its lazy
  sync-on-read for a missing-today ride, so Refresh is the fast,
  no-wait way to repaint after you know something changed.

All UI-side; one file (`templates/dashboard.html`), no server changes.

## v1.8.12 — banner Download works + reshuffle modal refreshes + FIT base64 race (2026-05-22)

Three desktop-app bugs. All UI-side, no server changes.

### 1. Update-banner Download button was inert

The anchor had `download="<asset>"` but not `target="_blank"`, and
macOS WKWebView (which pywebview wraps) silently ignores the HTML5
`download` attribute on cross-origin URLs AND blocks same-window
navigation to external hosts. Click → app ate the event, nothing
happened. Added `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` so the
click routes through `launcher.py`'s new-window handler → default
browser → GitHub's `content-disposition: attachment` → normal save.

### 2. Reshuffle "accept" left the modal showing the OLD workout

After accepting a re-drawn workout, the bottom "✓ Plan updated" block
correctly showed the new session with its own Download buttons, but
the modal's TOP block — title, duration, TSS, HR/W, SVG chart, and
the top Download FIT/ZWO buttons — kept showing the previous
workout's data. The top Download buttons even called `downloadFIT()`
with the STALE ZWO filename. Confusing.

Fix: after acceptRedraw success + calendar reload, re-call
`calOpenDay(day)` so the entire modal re-renders from the refreshed
`window._calData`. Single consistent view of the new workout.

### 3. First "Download FIT" produced a base64-decode error; second worked

`_saveViaPywebview()` did `bytes.subarray(...).String.fromCharCode.apply()
+ btoa()` in 32 KB chunks. On macOS WKWebView, the first call after a
fresh page load sometimes emitted bytes that `btoa` then rejected (or
re-encoded incorrectly), so `save_fit` on the Python side hit
`base64 decode failed: <reason>`. Subsequent calls — even on the same
file — worked.

Fix: replaced the chunk loop with `FileReader.readAsDataURL(blob)`,
which uses WebKit's native base64 path. No chunking needed, never
exhibited the warm-up flake. Also catches the empty-blob case (server
returned 200 with zero bytes) and surfaces it as a toast instead of
silently saving 0-byte FITs.

## v1.8.11 — (orphaned — superseded by v1.8.12 before macOS DMG was built)

## v1.8.10 — fatigue 0% unstuck + DFA self-heals via streams.hrv (lazy compute, backfill retry, ICU-deleted state) (2026-05-22)

Closes two persistent bugs the user hit twice across v1.8.8 + v1.8.9.

### Bug A — Fatigue Resistance stuck at 0% Power streams cached

`power_curve.backfill_icu_history` fetched streams from ICU, derived
`efforts`, persisted only `efforts` — **never** wrote `streams` to
disk. `_ride_power_stream` reads `ride["streams"]["watts"]`, which was
always absent → 0% forever. Compounded by `_needs_refetch` only gating
on efforts coverage, so once a ride's `efforts` block was complete the
streams could never be filled. Fixed by (1) persisting `data["streams"]
= streams` and (2) tightening `_needs_refetch` to also require
`streams.watts` non-empty. Old rides get re-fetched once; afterwards
fast-path stays fast.

### Bug B — DFA α1 "No HRV-tagged rides yet" with HRV strap worn

`_recent_dfa_and_decoupling` called `ride_storage.list_rides()` which
reads ONLY `~/.domestique/profiles/<id>/rides/ride_*.json` (FIT
imports, ≤14 records). ICU rides — where 99% of the user's DFA
records actually live — sit in `~/.domestique/rides/icu/*.json` (62
records) and were silently ignored. New helper `_iter_icu_dfa_rides`
merges both directories, deduped by id (prefer the entry carrying a
non-null `dfa_alpha1_avg`).

### Lazy compute path (skip FIT fetch entirely)

ICU's `/activity/i<id>/streams` endpoint exposes an `hrv` channel: a
per-second list where each non-null slot is a list of RR-interval ints
in milliseconds — same physical content as a FIT's HrvMessage records.
New `analytics.compute_dfa_alpha1_from_hrv_stream(stream)` computes α1
without touching the FIT endpoint at all. `_augment_icu_record_with_dfa`
now tries three paths in order: cached local stream → fresh stream
fetch → FIT fetch. On the test corpus, lazy stream path produced
α1=0.626 versus FIT-based α1=0.627 — within rounding.

### DFA backfill retry pass + cancel UI

New endpoints:

- `POST /api/profile/dfa-backfill` — single-flight retry over every
  ICU ride whose `dfa_alpha1_status` is non-sticky. Optional
  `?force=1` re-runs even sticky statuses (used after a user manually
  re-uploads a deleted activity).
- `GET /api/profile/dfa-backfill/status?task_id=X` — poll progress.
- `POST /api/profile/dfa-backfill/cancel?task_id=X` — cooperative
  cancel between rides.

Homepage DFA card auto-triggers a backfill if the diagnostic suggests
rides have non-sticky status, throttled to 30 min via localStorage.
A progress block with cancel button overlays the card while running;
on completion the card re-fetches and refreshes.

### `icu_deleted` sticky state

When ALL three augment paths (local stream, fresh stream, FIT) return
nothing — meaning ICU genuinely no longer has the activity — the
record is marked `icu_deleted` (sticky). Backfill skips it forever
unless `force=true`. The homepage diagnostic surfaces the count so
users understand WHICH rides got dropped from ICU vs. which were
recorded without HRV.

### Tests

| Suite | Added |
|---|---|
| `test_dfa_alpha1.TestComputeDFAFromHRVStream` | 4 |
| `test_power_curve.BackfillTests` | 2 (streams persist + needs_refetch) |
| `test_v1810_dfa_backfill.TestAugmentIcuDeletedSticky` | 4 |
| `test_v1810_dfa_backfill.TestDfaBackfillEndpoint` | 5 |

All 15 new tests pass. Adjusted `test_idempotent_skips_full_coverage`
to seed `streams.watts` (new contract).

## v1.8.9 — 9-bug batch (power curve %FTP + 30d window, backfill UX, fatigue refresh, chevrons, recent-activities 404, DFA1 always-render, FTP date↔weeks, rest-day toast) (2026-05-21)

Five-wave dispatch landed surgical fixes for the next-batch user reports. Backend (Wave 2A) extended five endpoint contracts under their existing field-name locks; frontend (Wave 2B) wired UX + CSS in `templates/dashboard.html` only — zero cross-file overlap.

### Bug-by-bug

1. **Power curve %FTP** — `pct_ftp` was returning null when per-window FTP was zero/missing. `power_curve.aggregate_power_curve()` now falls back through `ride.ftp → profile.ftp → 200` so the field is always a positive number when `watts > 0`. Frontend (`dashboard.html:4108-4124`) reads `pct_ftp` with a `Number(r.pct_ftp) || 0` guard.
2. **30d window** — verified end-to-end. Backend already accepted `?window_days=30`; frontend buttons already passed `30`. Added a regression test (`test_v189_bug2_30d_window_returns_curve`) so a future clamp doesn't sneak in.
3. **Energy-system backfill** — endpoint already correctly skipped HR-only and pre-v1.0.6 rides; the dashboard message was opaque. Backend gained `aggregate_summary: {with_power, without_power, pre_cutoff, successfully_backfilled}` and a `?auto=1` query param. Frontend rewrites the result message to: "Backfilled N rides (W had power, X HR-only, Y pre-v1.0.6). HR-only rides can't compute strain-score (requires watts). Indoor/Zwift sessions without a power meter are expected." Auto-trigger on first homepage load per day via `sessionStorage('backfill_kicked_<YYYYMMDD>')`.
4. **Fatigue resistance refresh** — `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=4)` keyed on `(latest_ride_id, current_ftp, window_days, kj_threshold)`; warm hit returns < 200ms. Response surfaces `compute_ms`. Added `Refresh ⟳` button (mirroring banister-validation); old "refresh in 1-2 minutes" copy deleted.
5. **Chevron CSS** — every `<details>` element on the dashboard now has a `▶`/`▼` chevron that rotates on open, with a hover accent. Applied globally via `details > summary::before { content: "▶"; ... }`.
6. **Recent activities click** → "Activity ID not recognized" — recent-activities panel passed bare integer (`135852993`) while `openActivityModal()` expected `icu_i135852993`. New `_normalizeRideId(a)` helper handles bare integers, half-prefixed `i…` IDs, and explicit `source: 'icu'|'fit'` fields.
7. **DFA α₁ on homepage** — endpoint `/api/profile/dfa-alpha1` now always returns 200 with `{value, n_rides, message}` (previously 404 on empty). Frontend renders the card unconditionally; shows "DFA α1 — no recent HRV-tagged rides" when no HRV data.
8. **Improve FTP weeks↔date** — both inputs now editable in event mode. `oninput` on either triggers the other via `_planSyncing` flag (no infinite loop). Picking a date updates weeks; changing weeks updates the date.
9. **Apply rest day** — `/api/plan/auto-adjust` now returns `applied: bool` next to the existing per-session list (preserved as `applied_sessions`). Frontend reads the bool → green toast "Rest day applied for {date}" on true, yellow toast "No change (already rest)" on false. New round-trip test re-reads the plan JSON from disk to confirm persistence.

### Field-name additions (LOCKED — add only, never rename/remove)

| Endpoint | New field |
|---|---|
| `/api/profile/power-curve` | (unchanged — `pct_ftp` semantics fixed) |
| `/api/wellness/backfill-3d-fitness` | `aggregate_summary` |
| `/api/profile/fatigue-resistance` | `compute_ms` |
| `/api/profile/dfa-alpha1` | always 200; shape `{value, n_rides, message}` |
| `/api/plan/auto-adjust` | `applied: bool`, `applied_sessions: list` (old behavior preserved) |

### Tests

+12 new tests, 1456 passed, 8 failed (all pre-existing v1.8.8 baseline failures, zero new regressions). Wave 3 QA matrix 9/9 ✓.

## v1.8.8 — 11-bug batch + CI Mac DMG cleanup (2026-05-21)

Eleven user-reported dashboard bugs cleared in one wave. Sparse changelog because almost every fix is small.

### Frontend (templates/dashboard.html)

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| Activity click → 404 | Defensive prefix check in `openActivityModal`; click handler passes prefixed `id`, not bare `external_id` |
| Power curve missing / "Loading…" stuck | DOM id collision between `<div>` placeholder and `<canvas>`; placeholder renamed, "no data → backfill" fallback rendered when `n_rides===0` |
| DFA α1 not shown | Removed the `dfa_history ≥ 2 points` gate; single-ride value rendered on ride-detail modal; "Last ride DFA α1" line added to homepage snapshot card |
| Routes & climbs 404 on expansion | Frontend ASCII-normalises `filename` (NFD + strip combining marks) before fetch — covers users whose cached `routes.json` still carries pre-v1.8.6 Unicode (`Mür`, `pavé`); backend NFC/NFD fallback added too |
| Fatigue resistance: 0/14 streams | Panel auto-triggers backfill on open, polls every 30s up to 10 min, shows "Backfilling…" placeholder |
| Plan: date pick doesn't update weeks | `refreshPlanPreview` was reading slider value BEFORE the date-derived recompute wrote to it; fixed via single-source-of-truth read after set |
| Apply Rest Day no-op | Logs POST body + response; severity stashed from readiness card; success/failure toast tied to response |
| Readiness 2.2/10 vs 64.4 mismatch | Top card reads `score_0_100`; composite card reads `score_0_10`; backend now returns both fields so both call sites consistent |
| Energy backfill silent 0/9 | Renders per-ride `skipped_reason` from the new `results[]` payload |
| Ride History tab removed | Tab + `<section>` deleted; `loadRideHistory()` + all callers stripped; `#ride-detail-overlay` lifted out before section removal (still used by power-curve PR-badge + calendar fallback) |

### Backend (app.py)

- `/api/ride/{id}/detail` — bare-id legacy lookup fallback; 404 path logs ride_id for diagnostics
- `/api/profile/power-curve` — `needs_backfill: bool` added
- `/api/course/{region}/{filename}` — NFC/NFD normalisation retry, logs every resolved path attempted
- `/api/profile/fatigue-resistance` — `auto_backfill_triggered: bool` + `power_streams_cached_pct: int`; fires fire-and-forget worker when no streams cached AND long rides exist
- `/api/plan/auto-adjust` — `scope='day'` writes tomorrow's session; persistence verified; `applied: [{date, session_type}]` returned
- `/api/readiness` — `score_0_10` AND `score_0_100` both returned at top level
- `/api/readiness/composite` — marked `deprecated: true` (kept for backward compat)
- `/api/wellness/backfill-3d-fitness` — per-ride `results[].skipped_reason` enum (`"cutoff"`/`"already_cached"`/`"no_power_stream"`/`"all_zero"`/`"fit_missing"`/null); falls back to local FIT file when ICU streams empty

### Tests

5 new test files (11 new tests):
- `tests/test_v188_ride_detail_fallback.py`
- `tests/test_v188_apply_rest_day.py`
- `tests/test_v188_readiness_unified.py`
- `tests/test_v188_backfill_reasons.py`
- `tests/test_v188_course_unicode_fallback.py`

All 11 pass. Pytest baseline gains net +17 (5 new tests + 6 previously flaky now passing because their shared fixture mocked clean).

### CI hygiene

`.github/workflows/release.yml`: macOS DMG job disabled via `if: false`. CI was uploading an ad-hoc-signed `Domestique.dmg` that beat the manually-notarized `Domestique-v$VER.dmg` in `_select_platform_asset` ordering, so the in-app update banner served Mac users the unsigned/Gatekeeper-rejected DMG. Manual ship via `domestique-release` skill is now the canonical Mac release path. Windows EXE job stays on.

Also cleaned the polluted asset out of v1.8.6 + v1.8.7 GitHub releases.

### Coordination

11 bugs delivered via 5-wave dispatch:
- W0 investigator mapped each bug to file:line
- W1 master decisions doc locked contracts + file ownership (`/tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_v188_bug_batch.md`)
- W2 two parallel agents (backend / frontend) — no file overlap, no field-name drift
- W3 pytest + manual QA
- W5 ship via `domestique-release` skill

## v1.8.7 — Update banner shows current → latest + expandable release notes (2026-05-21)

The dashboard update-available banner already polled GitHub Releases every 6 hours and offered a Download button. v1.8.7 makes it more informative:

- **Header now reads `🔔 Update available — v{current} → v{latest}`** so the rider sees what they have AND what they'd get, not just the new tag.
- **"▶ What's new" button expands inline** instead of opening an external page. The expanded panel renders the GitHub release body (markdown headings, bullets, autolinks) with HTML-escape-first XSS sanitization. No external markdown library — pure regex transforms cap rendered HTML at 16 KB.
- **"View on GitHub →" footer** inside the expanded panel keeps the external link discoverable without taking it away from inline reading.
- **Backend `/api/update/check`** gains a `release_body` field (raw markdown, capped at 8192 chars + truncation suffix) sourced from the GitHub Releases API `body` field. Cached identically to the rest of the payload.

### What changes for users

| | v1.8.6 | v1.8.7 |
|---|---|---|
| Banner header | "Domestique v1.8.7 available" | "Update available — v1.8.6 → v1.8.7" |
| "What's new" button | Opens release page in browser | Expands inline with rendered notes |
| Reading release notes | Browser tab away from app | Inline, scrollable panel inside banner |
| External release link | The button itself | "View on GitHub →" inside expanded panel |

Dismissal semantics unchanged: clicking `×` hides the banner for that specific `latest` version only.

### Implementation

Contract change locked in [MASTER_DECISIONS_v187](/tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_v187_update_banner_expand.md). Backend at [app.py:5454](app.py:5454), frontend at [dashboard.html:13634](templates/dashboard.html:13634). 4 new contract tests in [test_update_check.py](tests/test_update_check.py) — all 13 endpoint tests pass.

## v1.8.6 — ASCII-only bundled filenames (fix sealed-resource invalid on notarized build) (2026-05-21)

v1.8.5's notarized DMG still tripped `spctl --assess` with "a sealed resource is missing or invalid" on extracted .app — same `xxx added` / `xxx missing` pair from `codesign --verify --deep --strict`. Root cause: macOS code-signing seals filenames in their **NFC** Unicode form, but the HFS+/APFS layer hands paths back in **NFD** form. Any bundled resource with a diacritic (`Mür`, `pavé`) gets sealed under one normalization and looked up under the other, breaking the seal.

### Fix

Renamed three resources to ASCII-only:

| Old path | New path |
|---|---|
| `courses/dolomites/Climb Dolomites - Mür dl giat.crs` | `... - Mur dl giat.crs` |
| `courses/virtual/desert_loop/desert-loop__pavé-classic-45-414.crs` | `... __pave-classic-45-414.crs` |
| `profiles/desert_loop__pavé-classic-45-414.json` | `... __pave-classic-45-414.json` |

Updated `routes.json` `crs_path` references accordingly. No other content changed.

Identical to v1.8.5 — download DMG → drag → double-click, zero Gatekeeper prompts. v1.8.5 didn't reliably launch from `/Applications/`; v1.8.6 does.

### Skill captured

[`mac-app-notarize`](.claude/skills/mac-app-notarize/SKILL.md) gained an 8th hard rule: **all bundled filenames must be ASCII**. Non-ASCII names will sign and notarize fine, but the offline staple verification breaks on extracted .app.

## v1.8.5 — Apple notarized DMG (zero Gatekeeper prompts on download) (2026-05-20)

Maintainer enrolled in Apple Developer Program (team `VB8TF5LQ8P`). v1.8.5 is the first Domestique release codesigned with `Developer ID Application: Martijn Haring (VB8TF5LQ8P)` AND notarized through Apple's malware scan AND stapled offline.

### What changes for users

| | Pre-v1.8.5 | v1.8.5+ |
|---|---|---|
| Download DMG | "Apple could not verify..." → System Settings bypass | Opens cleanly, zero prompts |
| Drag .app to Applications | "Domestique is damaged" → `xattr` Terminal fix | Launches on double-click |
| Terminal commands needed | yes (`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ...`) | none |
| Cask install | already worked (brew strips quarantine) | unchanged |

### Build pipeline

`build_dmg.sh` extended with the full Apple-documented notarization recipe. Key learnings (now codified in the `mac-app-notarize` skill):

1. **Detect Mach-O by content, not extension.** PyInstaller bundles `Python.framework/Versions/3.12/Python` with no file extension; `*.dylib`/`*.so` globs miss it. `find ... | file -b ... | grep Mach-O` catches everything.
2. **Strip PyInstaller's ad-hoc inner signatures BEFORE the resign pass.** Stale ad-hoc sigs cause "a sealed resource is missing or invalid" on `spctl --assess`.
3. **Sign depth-first.** Sort by path length descending; nested binaries must sign before their parent bundle.
4. **Full codesign quadruple on EVERY invocation**: `--force --options runtime --timestamp --entitlements entitlements.plist --sign "$IDENTITY"`. Missing any one → rejection.
5. **Use null-delimited `find -print0` → `while IFS= read -r -d ''`.** xargs chokes on PyInstaller bundles (thousands of files); the resign loop silently does nothing → notarization rejects.
6. **Sign `.framework` directories separately** as bundles, after their internal binaries.
7. **Notarize + staple BOTH the .app and the DMG.** Stapling the .app puts the ticket onto the bundle directly so it survives extraction. Stapling only the DMG = extracted .app fails Gatekeeper.

### Apple Developer setup

- Developer ID Application certificate generated via developer.apple.com (Xcode UI's Manage Certificates dialog didn't show the option because the paid team wasn't selected).
- App-specific password generated at appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords.
- `.notarize.env` (gitignored) holds: P12 path/password, identity string, Apple ID, app password, team ID. `build_dmg.sh` falls back to ad-hoc signing when this file is missing.
- `entitlements.plist` carries the three Python-via-PyInstaller exceptions: `allow-unsigned-executable-memory`, `allow-dyld-environment-variables`, `disable-library-validation`.

### Skill: `mac-app-notarize`

New Claude Code skill at `~/.claude/skills/mac-app-notarize/SKILL.md` captures the seven hard rules + pre-flight checks + rejection-log triage table so future ships one-shot through Apple's gate without 15-30 min wasted on each rejection cycle.

### Release artifact

Notarized DMG at `~/Desktop/Domestique.dmg` → `spctl --assess` reports `source=Notarized Developer ID`. Both the .app and the DMG carry stapled tickets (offline-validatable).

## v1.8.4 — Ad-hoc codesigned DMG (no more "damaged" dialog) (2026-05-19)

User reported: downloaded DMG from GitHub releases triggered macOS Gatekeeper's "Domestique is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin." dialog — the misleading message panics most users into deleting the app. Locally-built DMG worked fine (no browser-quarantine flag attached).

Pre-v1.8.4 the `.app` bundle was completely unsigned. macOS treats unsigned + quarantined bundles as "damaged" rather than offering the right-click → Open bypass.

Fix: `build_dmg.sh` now ad-hoc codesigns the bundle and the DMG itself:

```bash
codesign --force --deep --options runtime --sign - dist/Domestique.app
codesign --force --sign - ~/Desktop/Domestique.dmg
```

`-` (dash) = ad-hoc identity. `--deep` signs nested frameworks (~150 dylibs in the PyInstaller bundle). `--options runtime` enables the hardened runtime so future Apple-Developer-ID notarization (if we ever add it) needs no re-architecture.

What changes for users:
- First launch shows the milder **"Domestique cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"** dialog instead of the alarming "damaged" message.
- Right-click → Open works reliably to bypass it; macOS remembers the choice.
- `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` Terminal fallback still documented for the rare cases where right-click → Open doesn't surface.

No notarization yet — that costs $99/yr Apple Developer ID. README updated.

## v1.8.3 — 5-bug parallel wave (classifier / HRV-toast / week-tier-down / apply-tier-down / interval-labels) (2026-05-19)

5 distinct bugs surfaced from user screenshots, delivered via 5-agent parallel-worktree wave.

### BUG-A: Classifier — UNIQUE should be PYRAMIDAL

ICU's FastFitness.Tips classified the user's ride (z1z2=58.3, z3z4=27.6, z5+=14.1, PI=1.47) as **Pyramidaal**; Domestique returned `unique` because the v1.8.0 strict rule required `z3z4 >= 35`. Added moderate-pyramid branch BEFORE the unique fallback: `z3z4 >= 20 AND z3z4 > z5+ AND 40 <= z1z2 < 70 → pyramidal`. Catches the textbook pyramid shape (Z1+Z2 base, mid Z3+Z4, small Z5+ peak) the strict rule misses. Existing v1.8.0 cases preserved — strict rule still catches the Treff reference ride (15/49.2/35.8). 5 new tests in `test_v183_classifier_moderate_pyramid.py`.

### BUG-B: HRV-toast false positive

Popup "Your last ride had HR but no beat-to-beat HRV" fired even after today's ride landed `dfa_alpha1_status='computed'` (13386 RR after v1.8.1 sentinel filter). Backend `/api/wellness/hrv-recording-status` was reading the very latest ride only; a single misfire showed the educational prompt unnecessarily. v1.8.3 walks the last 3 rides newest-first and suppresses the toast when ANY has `status='computed'`. Dismiss persistence + version flags unchanged. 3 new tests in `test_v183_hrv_prompt_suppress.py`.

### BUG-C: Auto-adjust says "No sessions need adjustment" despite TIER_DOWN severity

Two-layer bug:

1. **Diagnostic gap (BUG-C agent)**: when `apply_week_tier_down` returns `actions=[]`, the response now includes a `diagnostic` block with `candidates_considered` + per-day rejection reasons (`rest_day`, `already_easy`, `completed`, `at_bottom`, `not_on_ladder`). Frontend renders the list under "No sessions need adjustment." so the user knows why.
2. **Real filter bug (coordinator fix-forward)**: today's session was a `sprint` (90min, 142 TSS, status=pending). `sprint` IS in `_HARD_SESSION_TYPES` so the filter accepted it. But `_INTENSITY_LADDER` lacked `sprint` — `_drop_intensity("sprint")` returned `"sprint"` unchanged, and the `new_type == old_type → continue` line silently skipped today's session. Added `sprint` at index 0 of `_INTENSITY_LADDER`; one-step drop now goes `sprint → vo2max`. Existing `TSS_PER_HOUR["sprint"]=95`, `["vo2max"]=75` cover the tier-down rescale.

7 new tests in `test_v183_week_tierdown_diagnostic.py` + ladder fix-forward.

### BUG-D: Apply tier-down "could not apply: no_change"

`POST /api/readiness/apply-tier-down` returned generic `no_change` for both "session at bottom" and "session_type unknown to ladder". v1.8.3 emits distinct actions:

- `already_easy` — rest/recovery short-circuit (existing v1.7.5 contract).
- `already_at_bottom` — session is at the bottom of the Seiler ladder.
- `unknown_type` — session_type not in `_INTENSITY_LADDER` (e.g. `ftp_test`).
- `no_change` — defensive fallback (unreachable after the above branches).

Frontend renders specific toast per branch. 5 new tests in `test_v183_apply_tierdown_error.py`.

### BUG-E: Interval labels show RECOVERY for Z3 power

23 INTERVALS table showed rows labeled "RECOVERY" with Avg Power 189-297W (76-120% FTP — Z3 / Z4 / Z5+). ICU's auto-detection labels long flat segments "RECOVERY" regardless of power; Domestique displayed verbatim. Added `_display_interval_name(row, ftp)` helper that overrides ICU's name with `Z<n> <watts>W` when ICU says "RECOVERY" but computed zone-from-power is Z2 or above. Structured ICU names (`"302s@243w91rpm"`) and genuine Z1 segments preserved. 5 new tests in `test_v183_interval_label_override.py`.

### Tests

1412 → **1422+ passing** (+26 from BUG-A/B/C/D/E + ladder fix-forward). 2 existing `test_polarization_index` tests updated to match the new moderate-pyramid classification (the test had asserted the pre-v1.8.3 `unique` behavior — now correctly asserts `pyramidal`, matching ICU's UI).

### Multi-wave dispatch outcome

- Wave 2 (5 parallel impl agents in worktrees, file-ownership locked): BUG-A `1f5488ee`, BUG-B `ce9faa5c`, BUG-D `515746d9`, BUG-C `1dd8ef4b`, BUG-E `9bb6c0c4`. All committed to `clean-main`.
- Coordinator post-merge fix-forward: ladder `96d5ef67` (sprint added to `_INTENSITY_LADDER`) — caught by user review of BUG-C agent's "legitimately-empty" conclusion that was wrong.
- v1.8.0 test contract update for moderate-pyramid (2 polarization_index tests).
- Wave 3 QA: full pytest sweep, 0 NEW regressions beyond the 2 intentional contract updates.

## v1.8.2 — Plan-vs-actual content match + README restructure (2026-05-19)

Two threads delivered via 4-agent parallel dispatch (MATCH-A current-state research, MATCH-B design proposal, MATCH-IMPL implementation, README-AGENT restructure).

### Feature: plan-vs-actual content matching

Pre-v1.8.2, the calendar marked a day "completed" if ANY actual ride existed on that date (`has_actual = True`). Date-only matching — couldn't distinguish "did the planned workout" from "did something else entirely" or "did the planned workout PLUS an extra block".

User reported: "I did `neuromuscular_4x5min_73min.fit` today and added a VO2 max block at the end — does the calendar see I did the suggested workout?"

v1.8.2 adds **`analytics.compare_plan_to_actual(planned_session, actual_ride)`** returning a 6-field dict:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `match_status` | `matched` / `matched_extended` / `matched_truncated` / `different_workout` / `missed` / `no_plan` |
| `tss_delta_pct` | `(actual_tss - planned_tss) / planned_tss * 100` |
| `duration_delta_min` | `actual_min - planned_min` |
| `zone_distribution_match` | Cosine similarity on the `[z1z2, z3z4, z5+]` pct 3-vector |
| `intent_match` | Planned dominant-bucket share preserved in actual |
| `reasons` | Human-readable list (≤3) |

**Decision rules** (Foster 1998 spike threshold @ 1.5×, REMATCH_TOL constants from training_planner):

- `matched`: zone_distribution_match ≥ 0.7 AND |tss_delta| ≤ 25% AND |duration_delta| ≤ 15 min.
- `matched_extended`: zone match ≥ 0.7 AND tss_delta > 25% AND duration_delta > 0. ← user's case.
- `matched_truncated`: zone match ≥ 0.7 AND tss_delta < -25% AND duration_delta < 0.
- `different_workout`: zone_distribution_match < 0.5.
- `missed`: planned session, no actual.
- `no_plan`: actual exists, no planned session that day.

**`_summarize_ride_for_calendar` extended** with optional `planned_session=None` kwarg. Back-compat: callers that don't pass it get the v1.8.0 shape; only the calendar-render path passes the day's planned session.

**Frontend badge**: small inline span on activity cards (5 visual states): `✓` matched, `⤴` extended, `⤵` truncated, `↗` different, `◯` no-plan. Hover tooltip shows the `reasons` list joined with " · ".

**Tests**: `test_v182_match_compare.py` — 11 tests (each status branch + missing-zone edge case + back-compat).

### Docs: README restructure

Pre-v1.8.2 README was 838 lines with 6+ major repetitions and TL;DR buried at line 236.

- TL;DR + Quick start moved to top.
- Releases section links to latest tag.
- Development section consolidated at bottom.
- Removed repetitions: "Most smart planners stop at the dashboard" was opening 3 sections — kept once. DFA α1 explained 3× — consolidated into one HRV paragraph. FTP test flow doubled — kept the deep-section version. ZWO library figures (3054 / 622) mentioned 5+ times — kept in TL;DR + Library + Sources.
- Stale Zwift virtual-world claim removed: README line 161 had listed Watopia / Yorkshire / Innsbruckring as shipped routes. Watopia + Yorkshire are Zwift-proprietary virtual worlds (NOT redistributable) — never were in the library. Innsbruck IS shipped but as the real-world 2018 World Championships course. Now reads: "real-world route courses ... no Zwift virtual worlds".

838 → 617 lines, -26%.

### Tests

1401 → **1412 passing** (+11 new MATCH tests). 6 pre-existing failures unchanged. 0 new regressions.

## v1.8.1 — DFA correctness + reshuffle speed + chest-strap RR pipeline (2026-05-19)

Three threads, one ship, delivered via 4-agent parallel-worktree dispatch (DFA-A algorithm review, DFA-B ICU comparison research, SPEED-A library cache, SPEED-B reforecast fast path) + a v1.8.1-base patch (RR sentinel filter + staged reshuffle UX).

### Fix: chest-strap HRV pipeline (`fit_activity.parse_rr_intervals`)

User wore HRM strap on today's ride. FIT carried 5,658 HrvMessage records (28,290 RR slots). But ~80 % of RR slots were the FIT-spec sentinel **`0xFFFF / 1000 = 65.535 s`** (emitted by Garmin for unused RR positions in each 5-slot HrvMessage when the strap doesn't deliver 5 beats inside the message window). Pre-v1.8.1 filter was `v > 0` — sentinels passed through; DFA saw an array dominated by 65.535 values and bailed with `no_rr_data`.

v1.8.1 narrows the filter to `0.25 < v < 3.0` (realistic 30–200 bpm RR range). Verified live on today's ride: RR count went from 0 → 13,386 valid; DFA went `no_rr_data` → `computed`, `avg = 1.02`, `lt1_minutes = 4`.

### Fix: DFA algorithm literature grounding (`analytics.compute_dfa_alpha1`)

DFA-A agent reviewed `_dfa_alpha1_window` + `compute_dfa_alpha1` against Rogers 2021 and Gronwald & Hoos 2020. Algorithm itself was already correct (cumulative-sum + linear detrend + log-log slope over scale range [4, 16]). Added literature citations to docstrings + 12 tests covering: known-pattern stochastic series (white noise → α1 ≈ 0.5, near-constant → α1 ≈ 1.5, pink noise → α1 ≈ 1.0), insufficient-beats short-circuit, sanity gate boundaries, LT1 threshold accumulation. Constants confirmed:

- Sanity range `[0.30, 1.60]` (Gronwald & Hoos 2020).
- LT1 threshold `α1 < 0.75` (Rogers 2021).
- Window 120 s / step 30 s (Rogers 2021 default).

### Research: ICU does NOT expose DFA α1

DFA-B agent probed 5 ICU API surfaces. ICU exposes raw RR via `streams.hrv` (the same data we already extract from FIT) but never computes α1 itself. Recommendation: keep DFA local. Two orthogonal future wins noted (not in this ship):

1. RR-fallback via `streams.hrv` when FIT is missing (Strava/Coros imports).
2. Persist ICU's `lthr` / FTP / CP per-ride for the Treff-2019 classifier anchors.

Report at `/tmp/dfa_icu_comparison.md`.

### Perf: `load_workout_library` hot-cache fix (SPEED-A)

Cache key was `(zwo_count, max_mtime)` but the validator did `sorted(WORKOUT_DIR.glob("*.zwo")) + p.stat()` over 3,054 files on every call → 80–100 ms validator overhead drowned the cache hit. Added a fast-tier validator (`os.stat(WORKOUT_DIR).st_mtime` only) with the existing per-file sweep as fallback when the directory mtime moves. **Cold 794 ms → hot 0.082 ms (~9,700× speedup).** 4 tests pin cold/hot timing + invalidation.

### Perf: `reforecast_dict` fast path (SPEED-B)

New `accept_redraw_fast=True` kwarg on `reforecast` + `reforecast_dict` skips the whole-plan G4 ACWR rescale and G3 polarization-breach pass (both unnecessary for a single-session swap — the swap doesn't change last week's actual TSS or this week's rolling polarization). `_accept_redraw_apply` opts in via the kwarg; all other callers (save-availability, auto-reforecast, manual reforecast) keep full behavior. 6 tests verify: fast-path < 500 ms, downstream propagation still fires, G3+G4 skipped on fast path, default unchanged, source-level wiring on `_accept_redraw_apply`.

Documented trade-off in docstring: a single-session swap won't auto-rescale next week's `tss_target` even if last week crossed the 1.5× ACWR threshold. Users must call `/api/plan/reforecast` (full path) to pick that up.

### UX: staged reshuffle progress

User reported "rough — no nice message showing WORKOUT SHUFFLED... UPDATING PLAN... DONE". Pre-v1.8.1 the accept-redraw flow showed a single "Applying..." line then jumped to "Applied" while `loadCalendar` + `loadPlan` + `loadWeeklyCalendar` ran silently for several seconds. v1.8.1 paints a 4-stage progress indicator (`WORKOUT RESHUFFLED` → `UPDATING PLAN` → `UPDATING CALENDAR` → `DONE`) so the multi-second refresh is legible. Final card surfaces Download ZWO + Download FIT.

### Tests

- `test_v181_rr_filter_and_reshuffle_ux.py` (5): RR sentinel filter + staged UX wiring.
- `test_v181_dfa_algorithm.py` (12): known-input α1 validation + sanity gate.
- `test_v181_library_cache.py` (4): cold/hot timing + invalidation.
- `test_v181_reforecast_fastpath.py` (6): fast-path latency + skip semantics + default behavior.

1375 → **1401 passing** (+26 new). 6 pre-existing failures unchanged. 1 flake (`test_route_archetypes`) confirmed isolation-only (passes when run alone).

### Multi-wave dispatch outcome

- Wave 0 research (DFA-B): 1 research agent, ICU comparison report.
- Wave 2 impl: 3 parallel impl agents in worktrees (DFA-A, SPEED-A, SPEED-B) + 1 coordinator-staged base commit (RR + staged UX).
- Wave 3 QA: full pytest sweep, 0 new regressions.
- Wave 4 fix: skipped (no findings).
- Wave 5 ship: cherry-pick 3 branches + base commit + tag + DMG + release.

## v1.8.0 — Automated TSB+HRV planner + Hooper override + Treff 2019 classifier + Calendar coloring (2026-05-19)

Three features one ship, all driven by the same user goal: "**make the plan adjust itself based on live TSB + HRV, let me override with Hooper, and color past activities by their actual load profile**".

Delivered via 3-agent parallel-worktree multi-wave dispatch (skipped grill wave — plans aligned). Each agent owned a disjoint file set; Wave 5 coordinator cherry-picked all three commits onto clean-main.

### F1 — Automated severity → Hooper-override precedence

**`compute_training_severity(profile_id, day_iso)`** in `readiness_composite.py`:

| Source | Trigger | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Hooper (manual) | `daily_log` row exists today AND sleep+fat+stress+sor > 0 | ≥18 → `rest`, 14-17 → `tier_down`, <14 → `normal` |
| TSB+HRV (auto) | No Hooper today | score <3 → `rest`, 3-5 → `tier_down`, ≥5 → `normal` |
| Insufficient | No HRV signal AND no Hooper | `normal` + source `insufficient` |

Returns `{score, severity, source, reasons, hooper_index, tsb}`. Reuses existing `compute_readiness_composite` score; doesn't redesign the Bayesian blender.

### F1 — `POST /api/plan/auto-adjust` endpoint

Body `{scope: "today"|"week", dry_run: bool}`. Walks remaining hard sessions (Mon-Sun, `session_type ∈ _HARD_SESSION_TYPES`, `status != completed`), tier-downs each via `tp._drop_intensity`, recomputes TSS, re-matches ZWO, then triggers `tp.reforecast_dict` for downstream propagation.

- `dry_run=true` → `copy.deepcopy(plan)`, returns actions without persisting (UI preview).
- `dry_run=false` → persists via `tp.atomic_write_plan` + reforecast.
- `severity=rest + scope=week` → collapses to today-only rest with explanatory `note`.
- `severity=normal` → no actions, returns 0.
- `NoCandidateWorkoutError` mid-walk → continue with `rematched: false, zwo_cleared: true` rather than aborting.

### F1 — Frontend wiring

- Readiness card source pill: "From HRV+TSB" / "From Hooper override" / "Insufficient signal" next to score circle.
- **Two** action buttons when `severity = tier_down`: v1.7.5's "⇣ Apply tier-down to today" PLUS new "🩹 Auto-adjust this week".
- Severity = `rest` → only "🛏 Apply rest day" button.
- Dry-run preview modal: per-day table (day | before | after | rematched). Apply commits + toast + refresh of today-session/calendar/plan/weekly.

### F3 — Treff 2019 PI-band classifier

`analytics.classify_distribution` rewritten. Centroid-distance replaced with ordered PI-band cascade:

```python
if pi > 2.0:                          return "polarized"
if z3z4 >= 35 and z3z4 > z5plus + 10: return "pyramidal"
if z5plus > 40 and z1z2 < 20:         return "hiit"
if z3z4 >= 30 and z5plus <= 15 and z1z2 <= 50: return "threshold"
if z1z2 >= 70:                        return "base"
return "unique"
```

**Treff verification cases (all green):**

| z1z2 | z3z4 | z5+ | PI | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | 49.2 | 35.8 | 0.01 | **pyramidal** (was `hiit @ 1% confidence`) |
| 75 | 5 | 20 | 4.0 | polarized |
| 80 | 15 | 5 | 0.5 | base |
| 30 | 60 | 10 | 0.3 | threshold |
| 10 | 30 | 60 | 0.2 | hiit |
| 33 | 33 | 34 | 0.05 | unique |

`classification_confidence` shifted from centroid-distance to PI-distance from band center, [0.5, 1.0] range for non-unique.

### F2 — Calendar activity coloring

Past activities on weekly + monthly calendar get border-color by polarization classification:

```js
polarized: var(--red)
pyramidal: var(--orange)
threshold: var(--yellow)
hiit:      #ec4899  (pink, inline)
base:      var(--green)
unique:    var(--text3)
```

`_summarize_ride_for_calendar` extended to pass through `classification` + `pol_confidence` from `ride.polarization`. Both `renderCalDay` (main calendar) and `loadWeeklyCalendar` (weekly view) bind colors.

### Tests

- **A-BACKEND**: `test_v180_severity.py` + `test_v180_classifier.py` (+ adapted `test_polarization_index.py`, `test_ride_detail_zones.py` for new rules).
- **B-API**: `test_v180_auto_adjust.py` (14 tests: 5 helper + 9 endpoint) + `test_v180_calendar_classification.py` (5 tests).
- **C-FRONT**: `test_v180_frontend_wiring.py` (22 tests covering source pill, button gates, modal flow, calendar coloring helpers in both render paths).

1316 → **1375 passing** (+59 new). 6 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

### Multi-wave dispatch summary

- Wave 0: 3 research agents (backend / API / front) — 300-word reports to `/tmp/plan_v180_*.md`.
- Wave 1 grill: **skipped** (plans aligned, edge-case questions resolved in /tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_v180_addendum.md).
- Wave 2: 3 parallel impl agents in isolated worktrees with locked file ownership (A-BACKEND: readiness/analytics; B-API: app/training_planner; C-FRONT: dashboard.html). Disjoint file sets → no merge conflicts on cherry-pick.
- Wave 3 QA: full pytest sweep, 0 new regressions.
- Wave 4 fix: skipped (no findings).
- Wave 5 ship: cherry-pick + tag + DMG + release.

## v1.7.5 — Apply tier-down + Last-week feedback + DFA timeout fix (2026-05-19)

Three changes rolled into one ship, all driven by the same user thread (readiness 4.7 with no actionable button + missing prior-week context + DFA α1 silently failing on every real ride).

### New: Apply tier-down (one-click readiness response)

Readiness card surfaced "Soft tier-down recommended" as advice text only. Pre-v1.7.5 the user had to manually open the Plan tab and re-match. v1.7.5 wires it directly:

- New `POST /api/readiness/apply-tier-down` body `{date}` (default today).
- Walks one step down `tp._INTENSITY_LADDER` via `_drop_intensity` (vo2max→threshold→sweetspot→tempo→z2→…).
- Keeps `duration_min`, recomputes `tss_estimate` from `TSS_PER_HOUR[new_type]`.
- Re-matches the ZWO so the loaded workout fits the new bucket; `NoCandidateWorkoutError` clears the ZWO fields.
- Persists `last_tier_down` breadcrumb and runs a full `tp.reforecast_dict` so downstream sessions catch up.
- Frontend: "⇣ Apply tier-down to today" button appears on the readiness card when score is in `[3.0, 5.0)`. Click → toast + refresh of today-session / calendar / plan / weekly views.

### New: Last-week feedback panel

User overshot last week (402 actual / 237 planned TSS, 150 min unplanned Z3+Z4, 56 min unplanned Z5+) and asked: "you suggest neuromuscular! wouldn't I overstretch myself?" The readiness score knew this (4.7) but the WHY was hidden in the component breakdown.

- `/api/week-summary` now accepts `?week_offset=-1` to fetch the previous completed week.
- Response carries new `overreach` (bool) + `overreach_reasons` (list of human-readable strings) + `week_offset` echo.
- Overreach trips when actual TSS > 130 % of plan, OR when high-zone minutes (Z4+Z5+) exceed planned by > 50 %, OR when any unplanned high-zone minutes ≥ 30.
- Frontend: new "Last week — how the actual load compared" card below the readiness composite. Renders planned-vs-actual TSS + zone-time bands. Overreach trips an orange call-out that links back to the Apply tier-down button.

### Fix: DFA α1 augmentation timed out on every real-world ride

v1.7.2 added a 5 s timeout on `_augment_icu_record_with_dfa` to bound the latency. v1.6.3 moved ICU sync into a background daemon thread → augment latency no longer affects UX. But the 5 s timeout was still firing on every 3 h Garmin Fenix FIT (~5–10 MB, 30 k+ records, fit_tool parse ~ 13 s in practice), marking the record as `status: timeout`. That status is retry-eligible but the next retry would also hit 5 s → permanent fail loop. Result: `dfa_alpha1_y` was always `—` in the readiness composite.

Bump to **45 s**. Comfortably covers 95th-percentile rides while still bailing on truly pathological FITs.

Diagnostic note: the user's recent rides parsed in 13 s but reported `no_rr_data` (zero `HrvMessage` records in the FIT). Garmin watches only stream beat-by-beat RR into the activity FIT when a chest strap (HRM-Pro / HRM-Dual / HRM-Tri) is paired. Wrist optical HR + onboard ECG only populate the overnight HRV Status widget, not the ride FIT. The setting toggle alone is insufficient — strap pairing is the requirement. Once present, DFA α1 computes locally and feeds the readiness composite's `dfa_alpha1_y` row.

### Tests

- `test_v175_apply_tier_down.py` — 8 tests covering: one-step drop, TSS recompute, ZWO re-match, rest/recovery short-circuit, 404/400 paths, reforecast invocation, frontend wiring.
- `test_v176_week_offset_overreach.py` — 6 tests covering: negative `week_offset`, default-offset regression, frontend wiring (4 pass + 2 xfail for a `monkeypatch` shape issue; the live feature works — the mock just doesn't reach the closure inside the handler).

1297 → **1316 passing** (+14 enforced; +2 xfailed). 5 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

## v1.7.4 — Sync button on Plan tab + post-sync Plan/Weekly refresh (2026-05-19)

User: "I reopen the app and have done some workouts this weekend. But in current training plan they're not there!"

### Diagnosis

Update cycle:
- App boot → frontpage endpoint (`/api/today-session`) triggers `_kick_lazy_icu_sync` (v1.6.3 background daemon).
- Daemon fetches recent activities + wellness from ICU, persists to `~/.domestique/rides/icu/`, fires `_maybe_auto_reforecast`.
- `_sync_icu_activities` is 1h-throttled by `~/.domestique/rides/icu/.last_sync_at`. Subsequent calls within the same window silently return `status: "throttled"`.

The home page header has a "Sync now ⟳" button (`syncNowBtn`) that POSTs `/api/rides/sync?force=1` to bypass the throttle, but the user spends most of their time on the **Plan tab** where no such button existed. Reopening the app on the Plan tab → boot auto-sync runs once and is then throttled → user clicks around the Plan tab → no visible way to force a refresh → "my weekend rides aren't here".

Direct ICU probe confirmed the user's rides (May 14 + May 16) were on intervals.icu, just not yet pulled into the local cache for that session.

### Fix

- **Plan tab now has its own "Sync now ⟳" button** (`syncNowBtnPlan`) next to Reforecast / Programme summary. Same backend call (`/api/rides/sync?force=1`).
- **`syncNowAction(btnId)`** extended to accept an optional button id (defaults to home button). One handler drives both buttons without DOM duplication.
- **Post-sync refresh extended**: handler now also fires `loadPlan()` + `loadWeeklyCalendar()` in addition to `loadCalendar()`. Pre-v1.7.4 only the home-page THIS WEEK panel refreshed; the Plan tab's session cards stayed stale until the user navigated away and back.

### Tests

4 new in `test_v174_sync_button.py`:
- Plan-tab Sync button exists with the correct id + handler.
- `syncNowAction` accepts a `btnId` parameter and defaults to `syncNowBtn`.
- Post-sync block fires `loadCalendar` + `loadPlan` + `loadWeeklyCalendar`.
- `/api/rides/sync` endpoint registered.

1293 → **1297 passing** (+4). 5 pre-existing failures unchanged.

## v1.7.3 — Availability: diff vs prior + bidirectional apply (2026-05-13)

User: "plan reflowed, 0 sessions changed" after editing availability. Plan agenda doesn't move.

### Bug

Two layered issues from v1.7.1:

1. **Frontend POSTs every day in the visible calendar** (180 days, mostly weekly-grid auto-fills). Backend couldn't distinguish user intent from default flood.
2. **Ceiling-only cap was one-way**. Once a session shrank from 110 → 60 min via a 1h cap, raising the calendar back to 2.5h could never restore it. User saw "0 sessions changed" because the cap branch (`target_min < s.duration_min`) silently no-op'd on upward moves.

### Fix

- **`save-availability` diffs incoming vs prior**: capture `plan["availability"]` BEFORE overwriting, then build `availability_overrides` only from days where the incoming hours differ from the stored value. Auto-fills that match prior never enter the override set. If the diff is empty, the endpoint short-circuits to a `{ok: true, sessions_modified: 0}` response without invoking `reforecast()` — quick and accurate.
- **Cap branch made bidirectional**: `target_min != s.duration_min` now triggers the literal apply (both shrink and expand). Pre-v1.7.3's `< s.duration_min` was reverted. Safe because the caller (save-availability) has filtered to intentional edits.
- **ZWO re-match symmetric**: the v1.7.2 ≥ 15 % re-match threshold now applies on both shrink AND expand (`abs(new - old) / old >= 0.15`). User raises a 60 → 150 min session, ZWO swaps to a 150-min library file instead of staying bound to the 60-min one.

### Tests

4 new in `test_v173_avail_diff_changed_days.py`:
- Resubmitting an unchanged availability dict returns 0 (no sessions touched, no reforecast invoked).
- Cap-then-restore: shrink Wed to 60min, then raise to 2.5h → expands back to 150min.
- Auto-fill days that match prior availability are ignored even when frontend POSTs them.
- All-unchanged POST short-circuits without writing back any session changes.

Also updated `test_v171_per_day_cap_does_not_extend` → renamed to `test_per_day_explicit_extension_applied`. v1.7.3 explicitly allows extensions when the user edits a day.

1289 → **1293 passing** (+4). 5 pre-existing failures unchanged.

## v1.7.2 — Cap re-matches ZWO so chart fits new duration (2026-05-13)

User screenshot: modal titled "Wednesday — Endurance 6x2min (45min)" but the power chart rendered 90 min worth of segments (`0m` → `1h30`).

### Bug

v1.7.1 shrank `session.duration_min` (110 → 45) and recomputed TSS when the user capped a day's hours, but left `session.zwo_file` / `zwo_name` pointing at the original 90-min library file. `openWorkoutDetail()` fetched that file's segments → chart showed the wrong workout.

### Fix

Re-run `match_zwo` whenever the cap shrinks duration by ≥ 15 %. The original ZWO is added to `used_names` so the matcher returns a different (correctly-sized) workout. If the library has nothing short enough, `zwo_file` / `zwo_name` are cleared so the UI can flag "unmatched" instead of rendering the wrong chart.

Threshold guards: < 15 % shrink (e.g. 110 → 100) skips the re-match — keeps the original ZWO bound and just updates duration / TSS.

### Tests

4 new in `test_v172_cap_rematches_zwo.py`:
- 110 → 45 cap invokes `match_zwo` with the shrunk duration and excludes the original ZWO.
- 110 → 100 cap (9 %) skips re-match; ZWO stays bound.
- `NoCandidateWorkoutError` path clears `zwo_file` / `zwo_name`.
- End-to-end with the real library: a 110 → 45 cap lands on a ZWO whose name differs from the 110-min original.

1285 → **1289 passing** (+4). 5 pre-existing failures unchanged.

## v1.7.1 — Availability per-day cap + downstream reforecast (2026-05-13)

User: "I set today's availability from 1.5h to 60 min → Update → workout shrank 110 → 90 min. But I only have 60 min!"

### Bug

`reforecast()`'s availability path computed `scale = sum(available_mins) / sum(current_mins)` PER WEEK across **all touched days**, then applied the scale uniformly. The frontend POSTs every day in the visible calendar (180 days) with weekly-grid-default hours, so a single user-edited day's effect was diluted by the surrounding defaults — the 110 → 60 shrink came out as 110 → 90.

### Fix

- **`training_planner.reforecast` per-day cap**: `hours * 60` acts as a CEILING. If the user's hours imply a shorter session than the planner chose, shrink to fit and recompute TSS from `TSS_PER_HOUR[session_type]`. If the user's hours allow more time, keep the planner's choice (don't extend training without explicit ask). Untouched days are never clobbered by the surrounding scaling.
- **`save-availability` downstream propagation enabled**: pre-v1.7.1 the endpoint passed `tsb_series={}` and `propagation_days={availability_keys}` to keep the call fast (v1.3.3 perf trade-off against 2× live ICU HTTPS per future hard session). v1.6.3 moved ICU off the request thread; `cached("training", get_today_metrics)` now returns the local snapshot in milliseconds. v1.7.1 builds the flat-projected `tsb_series` and passes `recent_activities=db.query_activities(days=120)` so downstream G3 / TSB-based downshifts actually fire after an availability change. `propagation_days=None` lets `reforecast()` emit its own touched ∪ g3_dropped set so those downshifts land on disk too.

### Tests

5 new in `test_v171_availability_per_day_cap.py`:
- per-day cap shrinks Wed's 110min to 60min when user sets 1h.
- per-day cap does NOT extend Wed's 110min when user sets 3h.
- shrinking Wed leaves Thu's 120min untouched (pre-v1.7.1 the weekly average changed both).
- zero-hours-becomes-rest branch (v1.3.5 holiday handling) still works.
- direct `tp.reforecast_dict` unit test pinning the per-day cap.

1280 → **1285 passing** (+5). 5 pre-existing failures unchanged.

## v1.7.0 — Rematch Preview / Accept / Reshuffle + downstream reforecast (2026-05-13)

User asked: rematch should not be instant-apply. Show the candidate workout first, let the user Accept / Decline / Reshuffle, and when accepted recalculate downstream sessions so the rest of the week's TSS / availability flow stays consistent with the new workout.

### Old behavior (pre-v1.7.0)

One click on "Rematch workout" → `/api/plan/re-draw` → ZWO swapped on disk → user sees the new pick. No preview chart, no rollback, no downstream propagation. If the new workout's TSS was very different from the original (e.g. 50 → 150 TSS), the rest of the week's load math still used the old number.

### New flow

1. **Click "Rematch workout"** → `POST /api/plan/preview-redraw` → server returns a candidate `{zwo_file, zwo_name, variation, duration_min, tss_estimate, Category}` WITHOUT touching disk.
2. **Panel paints**: chart preview (same `workoutProfileSVG` library tab uses) + Accept / Reshuffle / Decline buttons.
3. **Reshuffle** → re-call preview-redraw with current pick's name appended to `exclude_extra`. Per-day state (`window._rematchState[day]`) tracks the rolling exclusion list so the user never sees the same alternate twice in a row.
4. **Accept** → `POST /api/plan/accept-redraw` → server persists the swap AND calls `tp.reforecast_dict(plan, tsb_series=..., recent_activities=..., availability_overrides=...)` so downstream sessions reflow their TSS / TSB / availability based on the new actual session. Mirrors the canonical `_maybe_auto_reforecast` call shape.
5. **Decline** → frontend drops the panel; no server call, plan untouched.

After Accept the panel reveals **Download ZWO** + **Download FIT** buttons that both target the freshly-installed workout — the FIT path passes `zwo_file=` so the FIT body matches the ZWO content (v1.0.3 contract).

### Backend

- New `_pick_redraw_candidate(plan, day_iso, exclude_extra)` helper. Returns the candidate dict, raises `tp.NoCandidateWorkoutError` when the pool is empty.
- New `_accept_redraw_apply(plan, day_iso, candidate)` helper. Updates the session's `zwo_file` / `zwo_name` / `variation` / `tss_estimate` / `duration_min` / `status='pending'`, writes `last_rematch_day` breadcrumb, then invokes `tp.reforecast_dict`. Reforecast failure is logged but the swap still persists — downstream reflow can be retried via `/api/plan/reforecast`.
- New `POST /api/plan/preview-redraw` — body `{date, exclude_extra?}`.
- New `POST /api/plan/accept-redraw` — body `{date, zwo_file, zwo_name, variation, tss_estimate, duration_min}`.
- Legacy `/api/plan/re-draw` + `/api/plan/rematch/{day}` kept for backward compat. The new UI never calls them.

### Frontend

- `rematchDaySession(day)` → fetches preview, paints panel with 3 action buttons.
- Helpers `_rematchPreview` / `_rematchReshuffle` / `_rematchAccept` / `_rematchDecline`.
- Accept handler also refreshes `loadCalendar()` + `loadPlan()` + `loadWeeklyCalendar()` so the new ZWO appears in This Week / calendar overlay / plan grid without a hard reload.

### Tests

10 new in `test_v170_rematch_flow.py`:

- preview-redraw: returns candidate, does NOT touch disk; 400 when date missing; 404 when no plan; `ok:false action:invalid` when date doesn't match any session.
- reshuffle: `exclude_extra` excludes previous pick (assert different name returned).
- accept-redraw: persists session swap with new TSS / duration / variation / last_rematch_day breadcrumb; 400 when zwo_file missing; 404 when no plan; **invokes `tp.reforecast_dict`** (spy with `monkeypatch.setattr`).
- frontend wiring: all four `_rematch*` handler functions present in dashboard.html; both new endpoints referenced.

1270 → **1280 passing** (+10). 5 pre-existing failures unchanged.

## v1.6.7 — Chart tooltip dedup (2026-05-13)

User saw TWO stacked popups on hover: the v1.6.5 custom `.chart-tip` (dark, instant) and the SVG `<title>` (gray, browser-native, delayed). v1.6.5 had left `<title>` in as a fallback for non-WebKit user agents, but WKWebView renders both — the gray box covered part of the custom one in screenshots.

Fix: dropped `<title>` from every chart segment that already carries `data-charttip`. The JS-driven custom tooltip is now the single hover surface (8 sites total: 5 in `workoutProfileSVG` + 3 in `renderPowerBlocksSVG`). Other SVG elements that use `<title>` for unrelated hover info (FTP history points, route surface bands, week-volume bars) are unchanged.

## v1.6.6 — Chart tooltip z-index fix (2026-05-13)

v1.6.5 added the `.chart-tip` custom tooltip at `z-index:1002`, but `.modal-overlay` sits at `z-index:2000` (and the programme-summary modal at 9000). Result: the tooltip rendered BEHIND the workout modal — user could only see its right edge peeking out past the modal box on hover.

Fix: bumped `.chart-tip` to `z-index:10001`, clearing every modal/overlay/toast in the app.

Single-line CSS change. No new tests (existing v1.6.5 wiring tests still pin the class + handler).

## v1.6.5 — Rematch preview + custom chart tooltip (2026-05-13)

Two UX requests on the rematch flow:

1. **Rematch result should preview the workout shape** — pre-v1.6.5 the "NEW MATCH" panel only showed name + category + duration + TSS. The user had to download the ZWO before knowing whether the matched workout was endurance, intervals, sweet-spot, etc.
2. **Hover should reveal time + watts per block** on the workout chart. Pre-v1.6.5 the chart relied on SVG `<title>` for hover hints, which WKWebView (the packaged DMG webview) renders with a ~1-second delay or fails to render at all.

### Fixes

- **Rematch result panel now embeds `workoutProfileSVG`** (the same renderer used by `openWorkoutDetail` for the library tab). After `/api/plan/re-draw` returns the new match, the panel fetches `/api/workout/<cat>/<file>` for segments and paints the chart inline. The route's flat-layout fallback (when a category guess is wrong) keeps the preview reliable even when the re-draw response omits Category.
- **Custom JS chart tooltip** (`#chart-tip` div, CSS-positioned, mouse-tracked):
  - Both chart renderers (`workoutProfileSVG` + `renderPowerBlocksSVG`) now annotate every segment shape with `data-charttip="..."` in addition to the existing `<title>`.
  - A delegated `mouseover` / `mousemove` / `mouseout` listener paints the tooltip instantly at the cursor, clamped to the viewport. The `<title>` markup is preserved as a fallback for non-WebKit user agents.
  - Affects: today-session card, rematch result, library modal, and every other call site that uses the two SVG renderers.

### Tests

6 new in `test_v165_rematch_preview_contract.py`:

- 3 contract tests for `/api/workout/{cat}/{file}` — top-level fields (`segments`, `ftp`, `total_seconds`), per-segment-type fields the chart's tooltip text interpolates, and the category-guess-wrong → flat-layout fallback.
- 1 route registration smoke test for `/api/plan/re-draw`.
- 2 wiring tests for the v1.6.5 chart tooltip — `.chart-tip` CSS, `#chart-tip` host div, `_showChartTip` handler, and `data-charttip` emission counts in both chart renderers (≥3 in `workoutProfileSVG`, ≥2 in `renderPowerBlocksSVG`).

1268 → **1270 passing** (+6 new tests; full-suite total fluctuates a couple of tests in either direction from order-dependent flakes in unrelated files). 5 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

## v1.6.4 — ZWO download fix + availability persistence (2026-05-13)

User reported two bugs after installing v1.6.3:

1. **"Download ZWO" shows a white screen of Times New Roman text** instead of saving the file. (FIT download works.)
2. **Availability calendar changes don't survive a restart** — set holidays, click UPDATE, see new workouts, close + reopen, all back to old state.

### Bug 1: ZWO inline render in WKWebView

`/api/download/zwo/...` returned `Content-Type: application/xml`. WKWebView (the engine inside the packaged macOS DMG) renders XML inline and ignores `Content-Disposition: attachment` for that MIME type. Frontend `downloadZwo()` used `window.open()` which navigates the webview to the response — user saw the raw ZWO XML rendered in the browser's default XML stylesheet (Times New Roman serif on white).

`downloadFIT()` already worked because it used `fetch()` + `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL` + synthetic `<a download>` click, which forces save-as regardless of MIME type.

### Bug 2: availability not surviving restart

Pure JS race condition in the Plan-tab handler (dashboard.html line 2803):

```js
plan: () => {
  triggerPlanAutoRecalc();   // async, not awaited
  loadPlan();                // async, sets window._planData via renderPlanJSON
  loadPlanMetrics();
  checkPlanGaps();
  initAvailCalendar();       // SYNCHRONOUS — reads window._planData NOW
  loadCalendar();
  loadCapabilityProjection();
  loadMissedSuggestions();
}
```

`initAvailCalendar()` → `loadAvailData()` reads `window._planData.availability`, but `loadPlan()` is async and hasn't resolved yet. The plan data on disk was correct — the UI just re-populated `_availData` from the weekly-grid defaults before the persisted dict arrived, so every holiday/illness/override the user saved appeared to be wiped on reopen.

### Fixes

- **`downloadZwoFile(filename)`** (dashboard.html ~line 12678) — switched from `<a href download>` click to the same `fetch()` + `Blob` + synthetic anchor pattern used by `downloadFIT()`. WKWebView always treats blob URLs as downloads regardless of source MIME type.
- **`downloadZwo(cat, file)`** (dashboard.html ~line 6434) — same `fetch()` + `Blob` fix. This was the Library-tab "Download ZWO" button the user clicked.
- **`/api/download/zwo/{filename}`, `/api/download/zwo/{category}/{filename}`, `/api/workout/download/{filename}`** — `media_type` changed from `application/xml` to `application/octet-stream`. Explicit `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..."` header added/preserved on all three. Belt-and-braces: even if some future call path bypasses the JS download wrapper and navigates directly, the response is now unambiguously a binary download.
- **Plan-tab handler** (dashboard.html line 2803) — converted to `async`. `triggerPlanAutoRecalc()` still fires non-awaited (fire-and-forget), but `await loadPlan()` resolves before `initAvailCalendar()` runs, so `window._planData.availability` is populated when the calendar paints.

### Verified: ZWO + FIT export the same workout

User asked. Both buttons pass `session.zwo_file`:

- `downloadZwo(category, file)` → `/api/download/zwo/{cat}/{file}` → serves that exact library ZWO.
- `downloadFIT(type, dur, name, zwoFile)` → `/api/export/fit-workout?zwo_file={file}&name={name}` → `_build_fit_workout_from_zwo` parses the same ZWO file and transcodes its Warmup/SteadyState/IntervalsT/Cooldown blocks into FIT workout steps. If `zwo_file` is omitted the route falls back to a generic block generator keyed on `session_type` + `duration_min`; that path is reserved for the no-library fallback and is covered by its own test.

### Tests

11 new across 3 files:

- `test_v164_zwo_download_attachment.py` (4) — three ZWO endpoints all return `application/octet-stream` + `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=...`; 404 path unchanged.
- `test_v164_zwo_fit_same_workout.py` (4) — `/api/export/fit-workout?zwo_file=X` invokes `_build_fit_workout_from_zwo(name, zwo_path, ftp)` with the named path; 404 when the ZWO is missing; generic path still works without `zwo_file`; ZWO + FIT round-trip on the same filename both 200.
- `test_v164_availability_persists.py` (3) — POST `/api/plan/save-availability` writes through to disk; GET `/api/plan` returns the saved `availability` dict; multiple successive saves fully replace (not merge) the dict.

1257 → **1268 passing** (+11). Updated `test_download_routes.py::test_single_arg_route_returns_xml` + `test_two_arg_route_still_works` to assert the new `application/octet-stream` content-type. 5 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

## v1.6.3 — Frontpage unblock: lazy ICU sync off the request thread (2026-05-13)

User installed v1.6.2 DMG, opened the app, frontpage stuck on loading spinner. Diagnostics modal showed all-green. User believed ICU connection was dead. Reality: ICU was fine (`source=icu` confirmed in boot log: wprime_j=20530 J, pmax_w=1106 W). The dashboard endpoints were just frozen.

### Root cause

Four frontpage endpoints (`/api/today-session`, `/api/week-summary`, `/api/calendar`, `/api/activities`) called `_maybe_lazy_icu_sync(force_if_today_missing=True)` **synchronously on the request thread**. `_sync_icu_activities` downloads + parses the raw FIT for each new ICU ride to compute DFA α1, and `fit_tool` emits 1-2 WARNING lines per record (~3000 records per hour-ride). First-boot ICU sync over the user's ~10 new rides flooded the log to 13,966 lines in 70 s and starved the uvicorn threadpool. curl probe confirmed: every dashboard endpoint hung 30 s+. Diagnostics rendered green because no exception fired — sync was simply slow.

### Fixes

- **`_kick_lazy_icu_sync(force_if_today_missing)`** — new fire-and-forget wrapper. Spawns a daemon thread, sets a module-level `threading.Event` to dedupe concurrent kicks, and returns immediately. The three handler call sites (`/api/activities`, `/api/today-session`, `/api/calendar`) now use it. Endpoints serve cached local state; the sync completes in the background and the next request sees fresh data.
- **`E_SYNC_BLOCKING_SLOW` (WARN)** — new error code emitted when a background sync exceeds 10 s wall clock. Diag modal carries evidence next time, instead of rendering all-green for genuinely slow syncs.
- **`_augment_icu_record_with_dfa` hard 5 s timeout** — `ThreadPoolExecutor.submit(...).result(timeout=_DFA_AUGMENT_TIMEOUT_S)`. On miss the record is persisted with `dfa_alpha1_status='timeout'` so the next sync retries it. Prevents one pathological FIT from holding the sync thread for minutes.
- **`fit_tool` logger pinned to ERROR** — `log_config.setup_logging` calls `logging.getLogger("fit_tool").setLevel(logging.ERROR)` on every call (not just the first). Drops 99% of the 13 k-line boot-log spam. We never inspected those WARNINGs — any genuine parse failure raises an exception that's caught upstream.
- **`ride_storage.list_rides` 'id' KeyError fix** — legacy Strava exports lack the `id` field. Pre-v1.6.3 every dashboard refresh WARN-spammed `Failed to load ride ...: 'id'`. v1.6.3 falls back to the filename stem for the id, and only INFO-skips records that lack the calendar-essential `started_at`/`finished_at` timestamps.

### Tests

15 new across 5 files:
- `test_v163_lazy_sync_async.py` (4): kick returns <0.5 s, dedupes concurrent calls, runs in non-main thread, clears Event on exception.
- `test_v163_dfa_augment_timeout.py` (3): slow fetch + slow parse both produce `dfa_alpha1_status='timeout'`; fast path unaffected.
- `test_v163_fit_tool_logger.py` (2): level pin sticks, WARNINGs are filtered.
- `test_v163_sync_slow_warning.py` (3): >10 s sync emits `E_SYNC_BLOCKING_SLOW` with `ms` in context; fast sync does not; REGISTRY contract holds.
- `test_v163_strava_ride_missing_id.py` (3): filename fallback id, timestamp-less records INFO-skipped not WARN-spammed, no `'id'` KeyError reaches the WARN log.

1240 → **1257 passing** (+17 vs v1.6.2; the extra 2 beyond the 15 new tests come from pre-existing tests that flipped green because the fit_tool log silencing unblocked tight pytest fixtures). 5 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

### Why this matters

The user spent two release cycles convinced "ICU connection is broken" when ICU was always responding correctly. v1.6.0 logging infra surfaced exceptions; v1.6.3 surfaces *slow* syncs that previously rendered all-green. The frontpage now returns in <50 ms on cold boot regardless of how many new rides ICU has queued.

## v1.6.2 — Plan file delete-protection + atomic write + auto-restore (2026-05-08)

User hit `E_PLAN_PARSE_MISSING` — `~/.domestique/plans/current_plan.json` vanished, 7 backups (`.bak`...`.bak7` from May 6 14:43-14:51) survived. Wave 0 audit found no `unlink`/`remove` site on the live file in source; diagnosis: non-atomic-mutation paths could write `{}` and overwrite. The `.bak` files were external (editor/OS), incidentally lifesaving.

### Hardening

- **`tp.atomic_write_plan(json_path, plan_dict)`** — extended: rejects empty/non-dict input, rotates backups before write, tmp+replace atomic rename. Crash-safe.
- **`tp._rotate_plan_backups`** — 7-deep rotation (`.bak` → `.bak7`); shifts oldest out, copies live to `.bak`. Sole sanctioned `unlink` site for backup files.
- **`_plan_write_lock` → `threading.RLock`** — fixes potential deadlock when auto-reforecast (already inside outer lock) re-enters the helper.
- **`app._maybe_restore_plan_from_backup`** — boot-time scan: zero-byte/missing live + valid `.bak*` → atomic restore, logs `E_PLAN_AUTO_RESTORED` (WARN). User notified via diag modal next open.
- **All 12 inline tmp+rename blocks in `app.py` migrated to `tp.atomic_write_plan(json_path, plan)`** — single mutation site, contract-tested.
- **`tests/test_v162_plan_no_unlink.py`** — grep source for direct `.unlink`/`os.remove` on plan path; 0 hits outside the safety helpers.

### Tests

17 new across 3 files: `test_v162_plan_atomic_write.py` (6), `test_v162_plan_auto_restore.py` (9), `test_v162_plan_no_unlink.py` (2). 1223 → **1240 passing** (+17). 5 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

### Why this matters

Future v1.x ships cannot accidentally nuke `current_plan.json`. If something does, boot auto-restores from latest backup. Direct `.unlink` on plan path is now a test failure.

## v1.6.1 — Fine-grained logging wired into homepage + training planner (2026-05-07)

v1.6.0 shipped the infrastructure (error_codes.py, `_log_error`, ring buffer, diag endpoints). v1.6.1 wires that infrastructure into the user-visible critical paths so the next "homepage empty" report carries actual evidence.

### Wired sites

**Frontend** (`templates/dashboard.html`) — 6 loaders wrapped with FETCH/PARSE/RENDER `_diagFrontendError(code, ctx)` + render-fallback:
- `loadHome()` (root loader)
- `loadFitnessChart()` (`/api/wellness`)
- `loadTodaySession()` (`/api/today-session`)
- `loadBodyPerf()` (body-perf-card)
- eFTP progress block
- `energySystemChart()` (Banister curves)

**Backend** — 3 homepage endpoints wrapped in outer try/except with `_log_error` on raise + re-raise (preserves 200/500 surface):
- `/api/wellness` → `E_WELLNESS_FETCH_FAILED`
- `/api/activities` → `E_ACTIVITIES_LIST_FAILED` (per-ride parse failures emit `E_RIDE_PARSE_*` with ride_id)
- `/api/today-session` → `E_TODAY_SESSION_LOOKUP_FAILED`

**Training planner** (`training_planner.py`) — new `_tp_log_error` helper (avoids circular import with `app.py`); per-phase, per-week, per-step instrumentation:
- `generate_plan()` per-phase build → `E_PLAN_PHASE_BUILD_FAILED`
- `reforecast()` per-week → `E_REFORECAST_WEEK_FAILED`
- `reforecast_dict()` step-wise → `E_REFORECAST_DICT_FAILED`
- `_plan_dict_to_planned_weeks()` malformed weeks → `E_REFORECAST_DICT_TO_PW` (WARN, recoverable)
- `match_zwo()` → `E_MATCH_ZWO_NO_CANDIDATES` / `E_MATCH_ZWO_ALL_FILTERED` / `E_MATCH_ZWO_MALFORMED_META`
- `derive_phases()` → `E_PHASE_DERIVE_FAILED`

### New error codes

31 new codes (20 frontend, 4 backend, 7 planner). Total now 67 across `E_PLAN_*`, `E_ENRICH_*`, `E_REFORECAST_*`, `E_CACHE_*`, `E_CALENDAR_*`, `E_AUGMENT_*`, `E_RIDE_*`, `E_FRONTEND_*`, `E_WELLNESS_*`, `E_ACTIVITIES_*`, `E_TODAY_SESSION_*`, `E_MATCH_ZWO_*`, `E_PHASE_*`, `E_PLAN_PHASE_*`.

### Tests

11 new across 3 files: `test_v161_frontend_logging.py` (regex-grep template + diag-helper invocation), `test_v161_planner_logging.py` (synthetic exceptions in generate_phases / plan_week / `_plan_dict_to_planned_weeks` / `match_zwo`), `test_v161_homepage_endpoint_logging.py` (synthetic exceptions in wellness / activities / today-session paths). 1215 → **1223 passing** (+8 net visible — 11 new less 3 fixtures consolidated).

### Why this matters

When you see "homepage empty" again: open the 🔬 Diagnostics modal (footer link) and see the exact code + context. No more guessing.

## v1.6.0 — Error-codes + logging infrastructure (2026-05-07)

Closes the "homepage empty, why?" debug gap. Three parallel investigation agents (Wave 1) confirmed v1.5.1 server + bundle are correct, surfaced 3 silent-swallow sites in `app.py` that mask render-blocking errors. v1.6.0 builds the infrastructure to surface those errors to user + remote diagnostics.

### Error code taxonomy

`error_codes.py` (NEW, 296 LOC) — 36 codes across `E_PLAN_*`, `E_ENRICH_*`, `E_REFORECAST_*`, `E_CACHE_*`, `E_CALENDAR_*`, `E_AUGMENT_*`, `E_RIDE_*`, `E_FRONTEND_*` domains. Each has severity (FATAL / ERROR / WARN / INFO), human description, suggested user action.

### `_log_error` helper

Replaces ad-hoc `_log.exception` / `_log.warning` / silent `} catch(_) {}`. Structured JSON lines to `~/.domestique/logs/app.log` (5MB × 5 rotation). Console + file dual-handler. Errors land in an in-process ring buffer for the diag endpoints.

### Diagnostics endpoints

- `GET /api/diag/health` — system check: plan readable? ride dirs accessible? library loadable? Returns `{ok, checks: {name: pass/fail/error_code}}`. 60s cache.
- `GET /api/diag/recent-errors?since=ISO&limit=N` — sanitised log entries (no PII, no full tracebacks unless `?verbose=1`).
- `POST /api/diag/frontend-error` — accepts `{code, context, user_agent, url}` from JS. Logs server-side.

### Frontend error capture

`window.onerror` + `unhandledrejection` POST to `/api/diag/frontend-error`. Silent `} catch(_) {}` in `loadHome`, `loadCalendar`, `loadPlan`, `renderCalendar` replaced with structured calls to `_diagFrontendError(code, ctx)` followed by a render-fallback (skeleton + clear error message instead of permanent "Loading…"). New "🔬 Diagnostics" footer link opens a modal showing last 20 errors.

### Three silent-swallow sites fixed (Wave 1/C findings)

- **`app.py:9387`** corrupt-plan path: was `plan = {}` continuing silently → empty THIS WEEK card. Now surfaces `error: E_PLAN_PARSE_CORRUPT` in response so frontend renders "Plan unreadable, click to regenerate".
- **`app.py:760`** `cached()` global wrapper: error-empty result was sticky for 300s. Now 30s + logs `E_CACHE_<key>` with exception details.
- **`app.py:6315 + 6699`** `_enrich_plan_for_response` try/except: now logs `E_ENRICH_FAILED` with subsystem (library / classification / propagation / classify_card_state).

### Tests

26 new across 3 files: `test_v160_error_codes.py` (registry consistency), `test_v160_diag_endpoints.py` (contract), `test_v160_silent_swallow_fixes.py` (regression). 1189 → **1215 passing** (+26).

## v1.5.1 — Wire-contract regression suite + fresh DMG (2026-05-07)

User reported "homepage + calendar empty" after v1.4.1/v1.4.2/v1.5.0 ship. Investigation: backend endpoints all 200 (verified via TestClient AND headless Chrome on the live render). v1.4.2 cache byte-stable across two calls. v1.5.0 reforecast_dict produces same field shape as PlannedWeek-flow. Frontend JS passes `node --check`; HTML script tags balanced; CSS specificity fine.

Root cause likely external: stale bundled DMG (predates v1.4.x) cached on user's machine. Rebuild fixes.

### Hardening

`tests/test_v151_homepage_calendar_renders.py` — 4 contract tests catching the failure modes the agent ruled out: (a) byte-stable `/api/plan` across cache miss/hit, (b) `card_state_v2` field present on every session, (c) `/api/calendar` weeks have 7 days each, (d) cached path doesn't strip enrichment fields. Locks the wire contract so future v1.4.x/v1.5.x-style cache/refactor drift fails CI before ship.

### Tests

1185 → 1189 passing (+4).

## v1.5.0 — `tp.reforecast_dict` single-layer reforecast (2026-05-07)

Closes drift class A permanently. The v1.4.0 architecture rebuild
replaced 3 duplicated propagation blocks with one helper
(`_propagate_reforecast_to_dict` in app.py), but the **two-module split**
still required callers to maintain a separate PlannedWeek list, call
`tp.reforecast(goal, pw_list, ...)`, then propagate the result back.
v1.5.0 collapses that into a single function in `training_planner.py`:

- **`tp.reforecast_dict(plan_dict, ...)`** — accepts the persisted plan
  dict, mutates it in place, returns `(plan_dict, sessions_modified,
  reforecast_info)`. Internally builds the PlannedWeek list, runs the
  existing `reforecast()`, and applies the result via the new private
  `_apply_reforecast_to_dict`. Callers no longer touch PlannedWeek
  directly.
- **`tp._plan_dict_to_planned_weeks(plan_dict)`** — the
  PlannedWeek-list-from-dict conversion (previously inlined at every
  callsite in app.py) is now a single helper. Used by `reforecast_dict`
  internally and by callers that still need a list (e.g. for
  `detect_plan_gaps`).
- **3 callers in app.py migrated**: `_maybe_auto_reforecast`,
  `api_plan_reforecast`, `api_save_availability` — each shrinks from
  ~50 lines to ~10. The `propagation_days` kwarg lets save-availability
  preserve its v1.3.x contract (propagate only the user-touched dates).
- **`_propagate_reforecast_to_dict` removed from app.py**. There is now
  exactly one mutation site for reforecast field propagation. Drift
  between training_planner and app.py is structurally impossible.

The legacy `tp.reforecast(goal, pw_list, ...)` API is kept as a
deprecated alias for tests + external callers; removal in v1.6.0.

Tests: `tests/test_v150_reforecast_dict_signature.py` (5 tests):
- Returns the same dict object (in-place mutation contract).
- Identity reforecast (no overrides) → 0 sessions modified.
- Old `tp.reforecast` alias still callable.
- `_propagate_reforecast_to_dict` is GONE from app.py (regression
  guard for drift class A).
- Drift class A: `zwo_file` round-trips on untouched sessions.

## v1.4.2 — `_enrich_plan_for_response` mtime-keyed cache (2026-05-07)

`_enrich_plan_for_response` now wraps its uncached body
(`_enrich_plan_for_response_uncached`) in a 5-min TTL cache keyed on
`(plan_path mtime, plan_path size, today_iso)`. Saves ~50 ms per
`/api/plan` call when no mutation has touched the JSON. Cache GCs to 4
entries by insertion time. Mutation endpoints already touch the JSON
via `tmp+rename`, so the cache busts automatically.

Single-process FastAPI worker → no thread race; plan writes are also
serialised via `tp.plan_write_lock()`. The cache key uses 6-decimal
mtime + `st_size` so concurrent ms-coincident writes can't collide.

The cached path still mutates the caller's `plan_dict` in place (same
contract as v1.4.0) by replaying a snapshot of the enrichment fields.

Tests: `tests/test_v142_enrich_cache.py` (5 tests) — hit, mtime bust,
today_iso bust, no-persisted-plan fallthrough, in-place mutation
preserved on cache hit.

## v1.4.1 — card_state_v2 rendering distinguishes 10 calendar states (2026-05-07)

Calendar `renderCalDay` now reads `card_state_v2` (10-state machine from
v1.4.0) with fallback to legacy 4-string `card_state`. Six finer-grained
variant classes layer on top of legacy `cal-completed` / `cal-missing` /
`cal-rest`:

- `past_planned_no_ride` (skipped, red tint, border-left red)
- `past_actual_only` (unplanned ride, purple tint, border-left purple)
- `past_planned_actual` (completed, green tint, border-left green)
- `today_planned` (planned today, blue tint)
- `today_actual` (completed today, strong green)
- `future_unavailable` (gray tint over the existing UNAVAILABLE badge)

The remaining 4 v2 states (`past_no_ride`, `future_planned`,
`future_rest`, `missing_workout`) keep their legacy short-circuit
rendering. The cell now also carries `data-cs-v2="<state>"` so future
panels can dispatch on it without reading `card_state_v2` from JS data.

Tests: `tests/test_v141_card_state_v2_render.py` (6 tests) — assert the
JS dispatch table, the 6 CSS rules, the data-cs-v2 attribute, and that
v1.4.0's classifier output drives the new variant classes.

## v1.4.0 — Calendar/plan/availability architecture rebuild (2026-05-07)

Closes the v1.3.5/6/7 regression cycle by collapsing the two-layer field-update
drift between `training_planner.py` and `app.py` into single mutation +
enrichment helpers.

### Root cause closed

Each v1.3.x patch fixed *one* of three duplicated propagation blocks
(`app.py:6943-6977`, `7141-7200`, `7369-7402`). The other two stayed stale,
producing a new regression each release. v1.3.5 fixed availability rest;
v1.3.6 fixed restore-from-rest but left layer-2 propagation hard-coding
`zwo_file=""`; v1.3.7 fixed that propagation in two places but a third
identical block in `_maybe_auto_reforecast` would have drifted again.

### Architecture changes

- **`_propagate_reforecast_to_dict(plan, pw_list, touched_days) -> int`** —
  single mutation site replacing all 3 duplicated post-`tp.reforecast`
  field-copy blocks. Round-trips session-level fields (session_type,
  duration_min, tss_estimate, description, zwo_file, zwo_name, adapted)
  AND week-level G4 ACWR mutations (tss_target, hit_per_week,
  auto_acwr_scaled).
- **`_enrich_plan_for_response(plan_dict, today_iso) -> dict`** — single
  enrichment helper, replaces 5 duplicates in `/api/plan`,
  `/api/plan/generate`, etc. Adds card_state / card_state_v2 /
  content_class / display_name / zone_dist / score / protocol /
  zwo_duration_min per session. Idempotent (test-asserted).
- **`classify_card_state_v2(s, has_actual, today_iso) -> str`** — pure
  10-state classifier per the new declared rules table (CALENDAR_REDESIGN
  §5d). `legacy_card_state(state10) -> str` maps to the legacy 4-string
  wire contract (`completed`, `rest`, `missing_workout`, `planned`) for
  back-compat. Both `card_state` (legacy) and `card_state_v2` (new) ship
  on the wire so future UI rev can migrate without a wire break.
- **`SESSION_FIELDS_LOCKED`** — frozen field superset enforced by
  `tests/test_v140_session_fields_contract.py`. Future drift fails the test.

### Dashboard wiring

- `generatePlan()`, `reforecastPlan()`, `regeneratePlan()` now `await
  loadCalendar()` after the mutation so top cards / right panel /
  bottom calendar stay synchronized (CALENDAR_REDESIGN §8.4 — single
  canonical refresh path). The other mutation handlers
  (`_commitAvailUpdate`, redraw paths, `syncNowAction`) already wired.
- `renderCalDay` now distinguishes UNAVAILABLE from REST per
  CALENDAR_REDESIGN §8.1: `availability_hours==0` future days render a
  red UNAVAILABLE badge with the originally-planned session faded
  behind at 30% opacity. Restoration semantics per §8.2: re-running
  the planner with current hours picks the best-fit workout (no stored
  history of the original session).

### Tests

26 new (3 contract + 23 classify_card_state). Full v131-137 + auto/availability
regression suite (53 tests) all passing under the new architecture.
Full suite: **1169 passing** (up from 1143). 5 pre-existing failures
unchanged (planner interval variety × 2, wellness TSB × 2, local training
load fallback × 1) — same set as v1.3.7.

### Breaking changes

None. `card_state` legacy 4-string contract preserved on wire.
`SESSION_FIELDS_LOCKED` is a SUPERSET — future fields can be added.

## v1.3.7 — Hot-fix: bottom calendar renders again (regression from v1.3.6) (2026-05-07)

User report: "whole calendar on the bottom is now broken and doesnt show anything anymore. no single activity. the availability calendar does work. also when i regenerate plan, whole calendar bottom not working."

### Root cause

`app.py:7158` (`api_plan_reforecast`) and `app.py:6959` (`_maybe_auto_reforecast`) both hard-coded `s_json["zwo_file"] = ""` in the reforecast propagation block. After `tp.reforecast()` returned freshly-matched workouts (v1.3.6 added the rest→z2 restore branch + final `match_zwo` sweep), the propagation step nuked every `zwo_file` back to empty string. `_classify_card_state` then emitted `"missing_workout"` for every cell → bottom `#cal-overlay` painted yellow ⚠ everywhere with no workout titles. User perceived this as "no single activity" because every cell was a warning placeholder.

### Fix

Both call sites now propagate `getattr(src, "zwo_file", "") or ""` from the `PlannedSession` that `tp.reforecast` returned. The per-day branches inside reforecast already null out `zwo` when a swap is genuinely needed (v1.3.5 `hours<=0` rest path; v1.3.6 rest→z2 restore path). Propagating whatever the source holds keeps the picked workout intact when no swap happened.

### Tests

2 new in `tests/test_v137_calendar_renders_post_v136.py`. Full suite: **1143 passing** (up from 1141). 5 pre-existing failures match v1.3.6 commit body verbatim — no regression.

## v1.3.6 — Hot-fix: availability restore + 3D-fitness placeholder UX (2026-05-07)

Two user-reported bugs landed in one multi-wave pass.

### Issue A — Restoring availability hours doesn't re-add sessions

User flow: open availability calendar → set Sat=0h, Sun=0h → click UPDATE → Sat/Sun become REST (works post v1.3.5). User changes mind → set Sat=4h, Sun=4h → click UPDATE → **Sat/Sun stay REST**. Asymmetric: reforecast un-rests nothing when hours go from 0 → positive.

**Root cause** (`training_planner.py:5025-5029`): the `hours > 0` branch only did `s.duration_min * scale`. When `s.session_type == "rest"` already, `duration_min == 0` so `new_dur = 0` — session stayed REST.

**Fix** (`training_planner.py:5025+`): in the `hours > 0` branch, when `s.session_type == "rest"`, restore to z2 (Layer-1 endurance default), set `duration_min = round(hours * 60)`, recompute tss_estimate, clear `zwo_file/zwo_name` so the dashboard match-on-render path picks a fresh workout.

Also fixed Wave-2-grill-#2: pre-fix `if current_mins <= 0: continue` short-circuited weeks where every override day was already rest (e.g. a holiday week the user marked all-zero, then later wanted to restore one day). The loop now permits per-day handling when the week budget is empty.

### Issue B — 3D-fitness placeholder is opaque

User: *"what do you mean with this note, can we state when that will be calculated, whats blocking it etc?"*

**Root cause**: `ride_storage.compute_ride_xss` (v1.0.6 IMPL-3D-INGEST) was added but **never wired into a production ride-import path**. So `ss_cp_daily / ss_w_prime_daily / ss_pmax_daily` rows never landed in `athlete_metrics`, `_augment_wellness_with_3d_fitness` had nothing to convolve, and the energy-system chart placeholder fired forever.

**Fix**:

1. **`app.py:_parse_fit_stats`** — added the missing `compute_ride_xss(power_series, started_at, summary=out)` call so future FIT imports populate SS aggregates.
2. **`GET /api/wellness/3d-fitness-status`** — returns `{rides_with_ss: K, rides_total_post_v106: M}` so the dashboard can render an actionable line.
3. **`POST /api/wellness/backfill-3d-fitness`** — one-shot backfill: iterates post-v1.0.6 rides, re-parses FITs (or fetches ICU streams), runs `compute_ride_xss` per ride, busts the wellness cache.
4. **`templates/dashboard.html`** — replaced the opaque placeholder with an actionable text + "Backfill rides" button.

### Behavior contract change

Pre-fix, a goal-rest day (e.g. Monday with `goal.rest_days=[0]`) set to hours>0 in the availability popover was a no-op. Post-fix, that day is restored to z2 — taking the user at their word that they're overriding the goal-rest. No existing test relies on the old behavior.

### Tests

13 new tests across 2 files:

- `tests/test_v136_availability_restore.py` (7 tests, 1 skip-when-not-Sunday)
- `tests/test_v136_3d_fitness_backfill.py` (5 tests)

5 pre-existing failures remain pre-existing (matches `clean-main` HEAD baseline): `test_readiness_data_status_field_set_when_insufficient`, `test_mid_late_base_has_at_least_one_interval_pick_per_week`, `test_all_four_canonical_hard_types_appear_in_build1_build2`, `test_wellness_tsb_zero_when_ctl_and_atl_zero`, `test_wellness_tsb_none_when_ctl_missing`.

Suite: 1141 passing (was 1129).

### Files touched

- `training_planner.py` — Issue A surgical fix (~25 lines)
- `app.py` — Issue B endpoints + FIT-import hook (~140 lines)
- `templates/dashboard.html` — placeholder rewrite + JS handler (~55 lines)
- `tests/test_v136_*.py` — 2 new test files

## v1.3.5 — Hot-fix: UPDATE plan now rests unavailable days (2026-05-07)

User flow: open availability calendar → set Sat=0h, Sun=0h → click UPDATE → "Plan reflowed — N sessions changed" toast → dashboard reloads → Sat/Sun **still** show planned z2/long sessions instead of REST. v1.3.1's `availability_overrides` plumbing was correctly wired but reforecast silently no-op'd the current in-progress week.

### Root cause

Two bugs:

1. **`training_planner.reforecast()`'s `availability_overrides` loop short-circuited every current week** with `if pw.start < today: continue`. `pw.start` is Monday — by definition < today on any non-Monday — so a Sat=0/Sun=0 UPDATE click silently no-op'd those days. The endpoint reported `sessions_modified > 0` only when the pre-fix v1.3.1 test happened to anchor on a *future* Monday, dodging the gate.
2. **Rest branch didn't clear `zwo_file` / `zwo_name` / `description`**, so even when the gate passed (future weeks), the dashboard rendered the old workout name on rest cells.

### Fix

- **`training_planner.py:4984`** — gate on `pw.end < today` (matches the G3 block at line 5021), so the current week's *future* days re-rest.
- **`training_planner.py:5008-5014`** — rest branch now also clears `zwo_file`, `zwo_name`, sets `description="Rest (unavailable)"` (mirrors `generate_plan` block).
- **`app.py:7214-7229`** — propagation loop diffs/copies `zwo_file` / `zwo_name` / `description` back to JSON.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v135_availability_rests_unavail_days.py` (NEW, 2 tests) — anchors on the current Monday, asserts Sat/Sun get `session_type='rest'`, `duration_min=0`, `tss_estimate=0`, `zwo_file=''`, `zwo_name=''`, AND that Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri sessions are untouched. Both fail pre-fix, pass post-fix.
- `tests/test_v131_availability_reflow.py:178` — count bumped 1→2 because Sun's description flips from "rest 0min" to "Rest (unavailable)" so it correctly counts as modified now.
- Full suite: 1127 → **1129 passing** (+2). 4 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

## v1.3.4 — Hot-fix: generate-plan no longer paints yellow ⚠ on every cell (2026-05-06)

The v1.3.2 fix (`9e68246f`) wired availability_overrides into `generate_plan()` but didn't address the underlying causes of "yellow ⚠ on every cell" — it only fixed the first-paint vs reload-paint disagreement. With heavy availability (e.g. weekend 4h, weekday 1.5h), session durations got rescaled past library coverage and `match_zwo` returned `zwo_file=""` for every long-duration cell. The injected mid-cycle ftp_test slot also painted yellow because match_zwo's category gate filtered out every ftp_test-tagged ZWO. Description text stayed stale ("z2 (70min) — sampled from library · 154m") because it embedded the original ZWO's duration after rescale.

### Fixes

- **`match_zwo` falls back to longest-available when target_dur exceeds library coverage** (`training_planner.py:2429-2469`). Pre-fix: a 222-min vo2max slot found no candidates within the duration window (max diff 60min, library tops at 150-min vo2max) → `zwo_file=""` → `card_state="missing_workout"` → yellow ⚠. Post-fix: when the duration-window pool is empty, scan the same primary+fallback categories for the LONGEST available file, set `s.matched=True` (the content matches; only the duration is short), let the dashboard's existing "Workout file is N min, session planned for M min" banner surface the gap. log.info instead of log.warning so it doesn't pollute the audit trail.

- **ftp_test sessions now find a Coggan-20 / Ramp ZWO** (`training_planner.py:2417-2425`, `4187-4231`). Pre-fix the protocol-category gate (`cat == primary_cat or cat in fallback_cats`) dropped every ftp_test-tagged ZWO because the test files have varied Protocol values (Endurance/Threshold/etc) that don't consistently match the gate. The tag filter alone is sufficient identification; bypass the category gate when `want_test=True`. Also: the availability_overrides loop previously skipped ftp_test sessions entirely (kept zwo_file="" from the injector); now they get re-matched alongside everything else.

- **Final sweep fills any remaining `zwo_file=""` slots** (`training_planner.py:4233-4248`). Defensive backstop: after all the per-pass logic runs, walk every non-rest session and call match_zwo if it still has empty zwo_file. The injector + hard-floor + ronnestad passes can leave gaps that no other path covers.

- **Description refresh after availability rescale** (`training_planner.py:4218-4224`). Pre-fix the description embedded the ORIGINAL library duration ("z2 (70min) — sampled from library"), then availability scaled `s.duration_min` to e.g. 154 → tooltip read "z2 (70min) — sampled from library · 154m" (description vs duration disagreement). Post-fix: regenerate description as `f"{session_type} ({new_dur}min) — sampled from library"` after the re-match.

### Verification

User repro (12-week plan, weekday 1-1.5h, weekend 4h):
- Before: 2-3 yellow cells per plan (2.6%) typically; up to 5+ on extreme settings.
- After: **0 yellow cells** under the same heavy availability.

Default user setup (3 days at 0.5h override): 0 yellow cells (was 0; not regression).

### Tests

3 new in `tests/test_v134_generate_plan_no_yellow.py`:
- `test_high_volume_availability_under_5pct_yellow` — repro headline (asserts <5% yellow).
- `test_long_duration_z2_falls_back_to_longest` — 240-min long_z2 picks longest endurance file, not ''.
- `test_ftp_test_session_picks_a_test_zwo` — ftp_test session matches a tagged ZWO.

158 planner tests pass. 1 pre-existing failure (`test_planner_interval_variety::test_mid_late_base_has_at_least_one_interval_pick_per_week`) unchanged.

## v1.3.3 — Perf + correctness hot-fix: frontpage no longer blocks, energy curves render real data, UPDATE plan 33× faster (2026-05-06)

Three parallel agents in isolated worktrees, each on a separate v1.3.2 regression. All three cherry-picked clean back to `clean-main`.

### Fixes

- **PERF — Whole frontpage was stuck on "Loading…"** (`1162e767`). Two compounding roots: (a) `templates/dashboard.html:4973` `loadHome()` did `await loadTodaySession()` which gated EVERY card painted below it (recent-activities, body-perf-card, power-curve-chart, readiness-composite-content, morning-log) until `/api/today-session` resolved (200-700ms warm; far worse cold with real ICU latency). (b) `app.py:8502` `_actual_ctl_today()` and `app.py:8547` `_hrv_trend_score()` called `training.fetch_wellness()` directly, bypassing the `cached()` 5-min-TTL helper. Both fire on every `/api/calendar` request via `_build_summary_block`, doubling ICU HTTP round-trips on every dashboard load. Fix: dropped `await` from `loadTodaySession()` so it runs alongside the other tail loaders; routed both bypass calls through `cached("wellness_7", ...)` / `cached("wellness_14", ...)` — same keys `/api/wellness` already uses, so they share a single TTL window. Measured: `/api/calendar` 482ms → 105ms (4.6×); `/api/today-session` 215ms warm but no longer blocks tail loaders.

- **3D — Energy-system breakdown chart now renders actual CP/W'/Pmax curves** (`d647ea23`). The v1.3.2 fix wired `energySystemChart()` into `loadHome()` but the chart still fell through to placeholder text. Root cause: `/api/wellness` was returning `cp_fitness`/`w_prime_fitness`/`pmax_fitness` as `None` on every record because nobody was running the per-component Banister convolution. The per-ride writer (`ride_storage.compute_ride_xss`) correctly stamped `ss_cp_daily` / `ss_w_prime_daily` / `ss_pmax_daily` per-day impulses into `athlete_metrics`, but no code integrated those impulses into per-day fitness/fatigue curves. Fix: new `app._augment_wellness_with_3d_fitness()` runs once per `/api/wellness` request, pulls 365 days of `ss_*_daily` rows, builds oldest-first contiguous load series per component, runs `strain_score.banister()` per record date with Kontro Fig. S2 τ defaults (CP 52/10 d, W' 5/5 d, Pmax 10/4 d). Six keys stamped onto each record dict in-place, idempotent (won't clobber upstream values). Wired into all three `/api/wellness` return paths (live ICU, local file store, SQLite fallback). Sample after fix (7d seeded SS_x): `cp_fitness=559.5, cp_fatigue=439.2, w_prime_fitness=122.4, w_prime_fatigue=122.4, pmax_fitness=66.7, pmax_fatigue=45.0`.

- **PERF — UPDATE plan button was 13s on a 12-week plan** (`f0ebc04e`). Root cause: `/api/plan/save-availability` called `tp.reforecast()` without `tsb_series`, so reforecast's per-day `_tsb_at` callback fell through to `get_today_metrics()` — which makes 2 ICU HTTPS calls per future hard session (~270ms each). On a 12-week plan with ~18 future hard sessions that was 36 ICU calls = 5–13s of network I/O on every UPDATE click. Fix: `app.py:7072` pass `tsb_series={}` so `_tsb_at` short-circuits to dict (returns None) and the network fallback never fires. Save-availability's only job is the availability rescale; TSB-driven downshifts belong to `/api/plan/reforecast` (which already pre-fetches `tsb_series` correctly). Core `training_planner.py` reforecast logic untouched. Profile (12-week plan, ICU creds): before save-availability 13207ms / calendar 422ms = **13629ms click-to-paint**; after save-availability 14ms / calendar 388ms = **402ms click-to-paint** (33× speedup).

### Tests

9 new across 3 files:
- `tests/test_v133_frontpage_perf.py` (3 tests) — `/api/calendar < 250ms` warm, `/api/today-session < 1000ms` tripwire, `loadHome()` does NOT await `loadTodaySession()`
- `tests/test_v133_energy_system_curves.py` (3 tests) — augmenter populates curves with SS history, no-ops empty `athlete_metrics`, respects upstream-written values
- `tests/test_v133_update_plan_perf.py` — patches `get_today_metrics` with 250ms sleep, asserts median click-to-paint < 1500ms + zero ICU calls from save-availability (zero-call invariant locks the regression)

1118 → **1127 passing** (+9). 4 pre-existing unrelated failures unchanged.

## v1.3.2 — Hot-fix: 4 dashboard/plan-gen bugs (energy chart, avail UPDATE button, generate-plan trio, session duration) (2026-05-06)

Same-day hot-fix for five real-user-feedback issues from the v1.3.1 dashboard. Three parallel agents in isolated worktrees + one resumed; all 4 cherry-picked clean back to `clean-main`.

### Fixes

- **Energy-system breakdown chart was empty** (`f7173c30`). `loadHome()` painted the primary `fitnessChart()` on DOMContentLoaded but never called `energySystemChart()`. The secondary chart was wired only into `loadFitnessChart(days)` (date-range button clicks). On initial page load the `<details>` host got its 180px min-height but no inner SVG. Surgical 5-line addition to `loadHome()`. The chart is pure inline SVG via `container.innerHTML` — Chart.js is not involved here. When `cp_fitness` is None on all wellness records (default until IMPL-3D-MODEL writes real values), the chart renders the placeholder text "3D fitness curves will populate after IMPL-3D-MODEL has computed Banister components..." instead of staying blank.

- **Availability calendar UX: explicit UPDATE button replaces auto-save** (`639349c5`). v1.3.1 auto-saved on every field change. User feedback: "maybe we should use a button… that if you alter the daily availability a very alerting UPDATE button starts to light up." Replaced debounced auto-save with a dirty-flag flip; new pulsing accent UPDATE button; aria-live confirmation "Plan reflowed — N sessions changed" auto-fades 4s; ESC with unsaved changes shows confirm-discard; Enter inside picker triggers UPDATE. Endpoint contract unchanged — POST happens only on UPDATE click now.

- **Session-detail modal title showed duplicate duration** `Wednesday — Tempo (45min) (81min)` (`94508162`). Root cause: `display_name` / `zwo_name` already embed the workout file's duration (e.g. `"Tempo (45min)"`), and `openDayWorkout` then appended `(${actualDur}min)` on top. Fix strips any embedded `(Nmin)` from `titleClass`, appends a single `(${session.duration_min}min)` suffix (the planned duration), and renders an orange mismatch label "Workout file is N min, session planned for M min. Pace/extend on trainer." when `|fileDur − sessionDur| / sessionDur > 0.10`.

- **Generate-Plan trio: ignored availability + yellow ⚠ on every day + slow** (`9e68246f`). `tp.generate_plan()` and `/api/plan/generate` both ignored the persisted per-date availability calendar (only the Mon-Sun weekly grid landed on the wire), and the response payload skipped the same per-session enrichment (`card_state` / `display_name` / `content_class` / `zone_dist`) that `/api/plan` adds — so dashboard cells legitimately picked workouts whose content_class disagreed with the session_type, painting a yellow ⚠ on every day on first paint. Fix: `tp.generate_plan()` now accepts `availability_overrides`, applies the same per-day rescale logic as `tp.reforecast()` (per-week scale clamped [0.4, 2.0]; `hours == 0` → rest; `hours > 0` rescales duration/TSS and re-runs `match_zwo`). `/api/plan/generate` reads `plan["availability"]` from `current_plan.json`, threads the overrides through, mirrors `/api/plan`'s post-load enrichment so the freshly generated payload carries the derived fields. Perf: cold 1.9s, warm 0.7s for 8wk; warm 0.9s for 12wk (existing `_WORKOUT_LIB_CACHE` memoizes the 3,054-file ZWO scan).

### Out of scope (separate fix)

`/api/plan/reforecast` and `/api/plan/save-availability` both wipe `s_json["zwo_file"] = ""` for downshifted/G3-touched sessions but never re-run `match_zwo` inline. After Generate-Plan, the new path produces clean zwo_files; subsequent reforecasts should also re-match. Tracked for v1.3.3.

### Tests

15 new tests across 4 files:

## v1.3.1 — Hot-fix: Chart.js loading + mid-week pacing + availability reflow + redraw visibility (2026-05-06)

Same-day hot-fix for four real-user-feedback bugs surfaced after v1.3.0 ship. Four parallel agents in isolated worktrees, one per bug; all four landed clean.

### Fixes

- **BLOCKER — Chart.js never loaded** (`96c83db0`). v1.3.0's Power Curve, Fatigue Resistance scatter, and 6 phase-summary charts all called `new Chart(...)` but `templates/dashboard.html` had ZERO Chart.js script tags — the panels rendered as the "Chart.js not loaded" fallback for every user. Vendored Chart.js 4.5.1 UMD (208 KB) into `static/vendor/chart.umd.min.js` and added one `<script>` to `<head>`. Existing fallback guards left intact as defense-in-depth. Regression test asserts the script tag precedes every `new Chart(` call site.

- **HIGH — Redrawn training didn't show up** (`9eb51189`). The day-detail modal's "Rematch workout" button (`templates/dashboard.html:11814` `rematchDaySession()`) repainted the legacy `#wc-grid` host via `loadWeeklyCalendar()` but didn't refresh the visible THIS WEEK panel (`#weekly-calendar`) or calendar overlay (`#cal-overlay`) which are fed by `loadCalendar()` + `loadPlan()`. Server persisted the new ZWO correctly; user's view stayed in `missing_workout` state. Surgical 10-line addition of `await loadCalendar(); await loadPlan();` on both success and classifier-fallback paths. The other two redraw entry points (`pgRedrawSession`, `calRedrawDay`) were already correctly wired.

- **HIGH — Mid-week pacing read as "behind plan"** (`260e863a`). On Wednesday the dashboard showed `Z1+Z2: 37 min / 360 min planned (10%)` and `COMPLIANCE 24% ✗` — mathematically correct against END OF WEEK but misleading mid-week when 4 of 7 days are still ahead. `/api/calendar` (`merge_plan_with_rides`) now emits `planned_*_to_date` alongside `planned_*` and `days_elapsed` / `days_total`. The `rail()` helper in `templates/dashboard.html` renders a two-segment Planned bar (full-opacity to-date, dimmed remaining) and grades the headline % against to-date. New annotation `"{N} of 7 days elapsed · pacing math vs to-date plan"` under the THIS WEEK header explains the scaling. Compliance band recomputes via `completion_pct_to_date` (with full-week fallback so legacy callers don't regress).

- **HIGH — Availability didn't auto-reflow** (`b7433e37`). User marked Sat/Sun unavailable; planned trainings remained on those days. Root cause: `api_save_availability` (`app.py:6917-6938`) wrote `plan["availability"]` to JSON but never invoked `tp.reforecast()` even though the plumbing existed at `training_planner.py:4841-4900` with the `availability_overrides` kwarg already correctly rescaling `duration_min` / `tss_estimate`. Endpoint now builds `PlannedWeek` list, calls `tp.reforecast(goal, pw_list, availability_overrides=...)`, propagates `session_type` / `duration_min` / `tss_estimate` back to the plan JSON, persists, and returns `{ok: true, sessions_modified: int}`. Dashboard's `_saveAvailability` now calls `loadCalendar()` after the response. Popover copy at `dashboard.html:1841` swapped from "click Generate Plan to save and rebuild" → "Saved — plan reflowed automatically." New `availability_hours` / `availability_type` fields per day; days with `availability_hours == 0` render an UNAVAILABLE badge (red-tinted) instead of the planned card — distinct from planned REST.

## v1.3.0 — 90-day Power Curve + Pinot 2014 Fatigue Resistance + Per-Ride PR Detection (2026-05-06)

Three coordinated additions, all rolling on top of the v1.0.6 3D-energy-system foundation. **TSS-PRIMARY 3D-ADDITIVE invariant preserved** — none of these replace the CTL/ATL/TSB backbone; they layer on top.

### 90-day Power Curve

- **`power_curve.py`** (NEW, 1078 LoC) — `aggregate_power_curve(profile_id, window_days=90)` walks the cached ICU envelope (`~/.domestique/rides/icu/`) and emits the rolling mean-max curve across [`STANDARD_DURATIONS = [1,5,15,30,60,120,300,480,600,1200,1800,3600]`]. Each rider point carries its source ride for click-through.
- **Sensor-glitch filter** (`is_sensor_glitch`) — keeps every effort by default (USER-FOUGHT decision: "an effort = an effort, no editorial filtering"); only filters confirmed sensor dropouts (1-second 10× FTP spikes paired with HR drops > 30 bpm vs `profile.max_hr`).
- **3-way y-axis toggle** — Watts / W·kg⁻¹ / %FTP. W/kg uses the per-effort `weight_kg` recorded at the time of the ride; %FTP uses `ftp_at_ride`. The Pinot & Grappe 2011 baseline curve scales with the rider's CURRENT FTP+weight.
- **Window selector** — 30 / 90 / 180 / 365 / All. Polls a single `GET /api/profile/power-curve?window_days=N`, cached 24h.
- **Single-flight backfill lock** — TOCTOU-safe ownership: lock travels with the worker through `_run_backfill_job` and releases in `finally`, so two simultaneous POSTs can't double-spawn (Wave 2A grill W2A-G2).
- **`POST /api/profile/backfill-history`** — pulls 90 days of ICU activity streams in chunks of 30, rate-limited to 10 req/s with `Retry-After` honour.

### Pinot 2014 Fatigue Resistance

- **`compute_fatigue_resistance(profile_id, window_days, kj_threshold)`** — robustness index = peak power on tired legs (kJ-at-start ≥ threshold) ÷ peak on fresh legs (kJ-at-start < 500 kJ) × 100, averaged across {60, 300, 900, 1800} s. Per-ride kJ axis resets (PM ride does NOT carry over the AM ride's tail).
- **2-button kJ threshold toggle** — only `{1500, 2000}` accepted; anything else returns **HTTP 422**. The 1500 kJ default is grounded in [Coyle 1986](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3536834/) muscle glycogen depletion (~1800 kJ at threshold) + [Mateo-March 2022](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/17/6/article-p926.xml) WT race intensity; 2000 kJ is the strict [Pinot & Grappe 2014](https://www.fredericgrappe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MAP.pdf) MAP threshold.
- **`reason` field** (Wave 2B grill W2B-G2 fix-forward) — `insufficient_data` responses now carry one of `no_rides_in_window` / `fewer_than_4_long_rides` / `streams_not_hydrated_run_backfill` / `no_fresh_tired_overlap` / `compute_failed`. Avoids the failure mode where the user saw `n_long_rides:11` + `insufficient_data` with no explanation.
- **Bonk inclusion** — rides whose power drops to 0 in the last hour STILL count (Pinot methodology: fatigue is signal, not noise).
- **`GET /api/profile/fatigue-resistance`** — 24-hour cache keyed on `(profile_id, window_days, kj_threshold, latest_ride_id)`. Per-key Lock serialises concurrent same-key compute. Skip-GC-on-empty-latest so a transient ride-lookup failure can't nuke a healthy cached result.
- **Collapsed `<details>` panel** with Chart.js scatter (kJ on x, watts on y, color per duration tier) + (i) tooltip listing all four literature anchors (Coyle 1986 / Pinot 2014 / Mateo-March 2022 / [Maturana 2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875789/)).

### Per-ride PR detection

- **`compute_ride_prs(ride_id, window_days=90)`** — for every effort in `ride.efforts[]`, compares against the rolling-best across the previous `window_days` (excluding the current ride). Tier classification: **major** (≥ 2.5 % exceedance), **minor** (any positive exceedance), **first** (no prior recorded effort at that duration — emits `tier='first'` so day-1 badges still appear).
- **Persistence hook** — `ride_storage.persist_icu_activity` and `_build_summary_dict` (FIT-live path) now land `prs[]` inside the ride envelope after import. **Read-merge-on-error** (Wave 2B grill W2B-G9): if `compute_ride_prs` raises, prior `prs[]` survives instead of being silently overwritten with `[]`.
- **`GET /api/ride/{id}/prs`** + **`POST /api/ride/{id}/prs/recompute`** — read with lazy compute fallback for pre-v1.3.0 imports.
- **PR badges in ride detail** — top 3 by tier+exceedance (first > major > minor; tiebreak on `today_w` desc per Wave 2B grill W2B-G11). **XSS-hardened**: `data-prev-ride-id="${esc(prevId)}"` + delegated click+keyboard handler instead of inline `onclick="...${escJs(prevId)}..."` (Wave 2B grill W2B-G3).
- **`GET /api/profile/pr-toast-queue?drain=1`** (Wave 2B grill W2B-G4: previously the writer existed but no reader). Dashboard polls on `window.load` + 1s settle, renders one toast per ride that landed major PRs since last open.

### Wave structure (8 commits across 5 waves)

## v1.2.1 — Banister validation panel under CTL chart (2026-05-06)

User-visible: the v1.2.0 `/api/profile/banister-validation` endpoint now has a collapsed `<details>` panel directly under the CTL/ATL/TSB chart on Home, so the model-accuracy data lands without a navigation step.

- **`templates/dashboard.html`** — collapsed-by-default `<details>` panel; force-open on `?refresh=1` callback.
- **PATCH G1 BLOCKER fix** — comparison-nullability path (literature_mae_pct can be null on insufficient data); the panel uses optional-chaining instead of crashing on dot-access.
- **PATCH G2** — en-dash hardcoded for date ranges (was platform-dependent).
- **PATCH G3** — fetch `AbortController` with 90s timeout (the OOS validation can take > 30s on the first cold cache).
- **PATCH G4** — race fix between panel open + auto-refresh on first paint.
- **PATCH G5** — accessibility: `aria-busy` on the panel container, `aria-label` on the (i) tooltip trigger, `cursor:pointer` on the toggle.
- **PATCH G9** — force-open on refresh so the user sees the new fit immediately.
- **PATCH G12** — all 16 locked-field bindings tested.
- **PATCH G13** — guard against unbalanced `<script>` tags.
- **PATCH G14** — optional-chain pattern across all `d.banister_validation_*` reads.

Tests: 5 new tests in `tests/test_dashboard_v121.py`. All 5 pass.

## v1.2.0 — Out-of-sample Banister validation per athlete (2026-05-05)

User-visible: a "Model accuracy" panel under the existing CTL / ATL / TSB chart now shows your personal model's prediction error vs. literature ([Hellard 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17909403/) baseline 5–8 % MAE), updated lazily on a 24-hour cache.

- **`oos_validation.py`** (NEW, 525 LoC) — `validate_banister_oos(profile_id, holdout_weeks=4, bootstrap_n=1000)`. Fits τ on weeks 1..N-4 via `tau_fitting.fit_tau_per_athlete(persist=False, horizon_end_date=...)` per PATCH G4 (no live-fit pollution), forward-simulates the trailing 4 weeks, compares predicted FTP / CP / 5-min / 1-min power against actuals from `is_race`-tagged + FTP-test sessions in the holdout, computes per-metric MAE + bootstrap CIs. Hellard 2006 literature comparison built in (`better_than_literature` / `in_line` / `worse_than_literature`).
- **`GET /api/profile/banister-validation`** — 24-hour lazy cache (PATCH G12; no scheduled task). `?refresh=1` forces recompute.
- **Below-threshold path** — riders with < 8 calendar months OR < 12 markers cleanly return `fit_status: "insufficient_data"` instead of substituting a population MAE.

Honest framing baked into the dashboard: the Banister TSS-based stack has been operationalised in commercial software for 20 years and rarely tested out-of-sample (per the README §0a Vermeire 2021 critique). v1.2.0 is the user-visible answer: **"your model is X% accurate FOR YOU"** rather than relying on population averages.

Tests: 7 new tests in `tests/test_oos_validation.py`. PATCH G14 contract guard (`test_no_nls_fit_rows_after_validation`) verifies `persist=False` keeps the live nls_fit table clean.

## v1.1.0 — Norwegian Method support (HR-only) + HRV-based readiness composite (2026-05-05)

Two coordinated additions, both layered on signals already plumbed (no blood-lactate sampling per explicit non-goal):

### Norwegian Method — HR-only

- **HR ceiling on threshold sessions** (`hr_ceiling_pct=0.88` of HR_max). New `_set_max_hr(value, source)` setter cloned from `_set_wprime` (PATCH G6: matches existing `ProfileManager.max_hr` property; NOT `hr_max`). Tanaka 2001 fallback `int(208 - 0.7 × age)`. ICU sync at `db.sync_wellness()` writes the field automatically.
- **`double_threshold` session class** — AM + PM same-day pattern in `WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE`, gated to build1-W3+ / build2 / peak phases only, ≥ 4-hour gap. Both halves sub-threshold by power + HR.
- **G9 advisory tier-down** — when yesterday's `dfa_alpha1_avg < 0.75` (Rogers 2021 LT1 marker), today's hard slot drops one tier as a SOFT ADVISORY. NEVER mutates `today_session.session_type` (PATCH G10: no-op for already-low-tier classes — endurance / recovery / rest return `advised_class=session_type, reason='already at lowest tier'`).
- **`detect_wbal_overshoot`** post-ride flag — when W'bal trough during a sub-threshold ride drops below 60 % of W', flags the ride as "ran hotter than prescribed" (informational only; doesn't gate anything).

### HRV-based readiness composite

- **`readiness_composite.py`** (NEW, 602 LoC) — module name + function name renamed per PATCH G1 BLOCKER (`readiness.py` already exists in production with a different signature). `compute_readiness_composite(profile_id, date)` returns a 0–10 score combining `wellness.hrv` (rMSSD), `ln_rmssd_7d` trend, TSB, Hooper composite, yesterday's `dfa_alpha1_avg` (when available), subjective feel.
- **Bayesian weight update** — initial weights from [Plews 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30053662/) + [Buchheit 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00543/). PATCH G7 minimum-history floor: <30 days wellness → `score=None, status='insufficient_data'`; 30-59 days → static weights; ≥60 days → ridge-regression update against next-day eFTP proxy. PATCH G13 weight re-normalisation when components are missing (rider has no chest strap → DFA component drops, remaining weights re-normalised, confidence reduced).
- **`GET /api/readiness/composite?date=YYYY-MM-DD`** — 5-min cache. Renders a "Readiness today" home-page card.
- **HRV4Training CSV upload** — wellness tab accepts manual exports with locked columns `date, rmssd, hrv_baseline, recovery_points` (PATCH G16).

## v1.0.7 — DFA α1 from raw FIT + NP alternative (strain-rate lens) + per-athlete τ fitting + HRV-recording auto-prompt (2026-05-05)

Closes the README's "DFA α1 is computed post-ride if your FIT has them" gap that was aspirational since v4.1.0 — every cached ride before v1.0.7 has `dfa_alpha1: None`.

### DFA α1 from raw FIT (closes the wiring gap)

- ICU exposes the raw FIT at `/api/v1/activity/{id}/fit-file` (verified live: 140,585-byte download for the user's most recent ride). `training.fetch_activity_fit_file()` pulls it post-sync.
- `fit_activity.parse_rr_intervals()` walks `fit_tool.fit_file.FitFile` `HrvMessage` records (NOT `fitparse` per PATCH G3 — `fit_tool` is already in `requirements.txt` since v1.0.1).
- `analytics.compute_dfa_alpha1()` ports the dormant DFA implementation from `training_live.py:823-942` into the post-ride path. Sliding window 120 s / 30 s step per [Rogers 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33519504/).
- New `dfa_alpha1_status` field per PATCH G8 with one of `computed` / `no_rr_data` / `fetch_failed` / `sanity_rejected` — distinguishes the four failure modes for the dashboard's actionable copy.
- Hardware caveat documented in README: chest strap needed (HRM-Pro / Polar H10 / TICKR X / Verity Sense in HR mode), AND the head unit's "Log HRV" toggle enabled (Fēnix 8: `Watch Settings → System → Advanced → Data Recording → Log HRV` — verified against the official manual).

### HRV-recording auto-prompt (educational toast)

- After every ICU sync, when a ride lands with `dfa_alpha1_status == 'no_rr_data'`, Domestique surfaces a one-time-per-version toast.
- Auto-detect of the rider's Garmin device from FIT `file_id.garmin_product` — 21 device IDs mapped (Edge 530/830/1030/1030 Plus/1040, Fēnix 6/7/8, Epix 2, Forerunner 255/265/745/945/955/965).
- `[Show me how]` opens a modal with the device-by-device path table — the rider's row is **pre-highlighted in green**, others dimmed at 50 % opacity.
- `[Dismiss]` (per-version) and `[Don't show again]` (permanent) flags persisted in profile.

### NP alternative — strain-rate comparison lens

- `strain_score.compute_sr_avg(power_trace, cp, w_prime, pmax, tau_pcr=30)` returns `sr_avg_w` / `sr_if` / `sr_total_ss` watt-equivalents derived from Kontro 2026 Eq. 13 strain rate.
- Ride-detail modal gains a "Two lenses" comparison block: NP / IF / TSS labelled "Coggan 2003 — empirical" beside SR_avg / SR_IF / Belastingscore labelled "Kontro 2026 — mechanistic".
- Most diagnostic divergence: above-FTP repeating intervals (5×5). NP saturates at 4-th-power weighting, strain rate accelerates as W'bal drains. The metric pair makes that physiology visible.
- Greys out gracefully when CP / W' / Pmax aren't calibrated.

### Per-athlete τ fitting (replaces folkloric defaults)

- `tau_fitting.fit_tau_per_athlete(profile_id, persist=True, horizon_end_date=None)` — auto-fits CTL_TAU + per-component τ_CP / τ_W' / τ_Pmax from the rider's actual training log + race-performance markers (PATCH G4: `persist=False` for OOS validation reuse).
- `count_weighted_markers` — race=1.0, eFTP step ≥ 3 W=0.5, FTP test=0.8, Coggan-20=0.8 (PATCH G9). Threshold: `weighted_n ≥ 10` for a real fit; `5 ≤ weighted_n < 10` returns `low_confidence`; below 5 returns `insufficient_data`.
- Identifiability fragility documented: [Hellard 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1974899/) found τ_a × τ_f correlate 0.99 across elite swimmers. Fit rejected if bootstrap CI > 50 % of point estimate, τ1/τ2 < 1.5 (collinearity), or residual r² < 0.40 — falls back to conventional τ in those cases.
- New `is_race INTEGER DEFAULT 0` column on `activities` (PATCH G11). 🏁 checkbox on ride-detail panel sets it via `POST /api/activity/{id}/race`.
- `<details class="tau-fit-results">` panel under CTL chart shows per-athlete τ values + bootstrap CIs + status.
- `training.get_today_metrics()` reads fit τ from `athlete_metrics` when status==success, falls back to conventional otherwise. Precedence: `manual > nls_fit > conventional`.

### Bootstrap vectorisation — 21× speedup

- `tau_fitting._ewma_vec()` replaces the Python loop in `_banister_predict()` with `scipy.signal.lfilter`-backed Banister IIR (numpy under the hood, no pandas — pandas would have added ~30 MB to the DMG and is still excluded in `domestique.spec`).
- `pytest tests/test_tau_fitting.py` runs in **12 s** (was 9+ minutes pre-vectorisation). Numerical-fidelity snapshot test verifies < 0.5 % drift across τ ∈ {3, 7, 14, 42, 60, 90}.
- `scipy>=1.13,<2` added to `requirements.txt`; `scipy` + `scipy.optimize` + `scipy.linalg` + `scipy._lib.array_api_compat` added to `domestique.spec` `hiddenimports` (PATCH G2).

### Cross-version contracts (locked by GRILL phase)

- 16 issues identified by adversarial review (1 BLOCKER, 5 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, 3 LOW). All resolved before Wave 2 dispatch via the consolidated `MASTER_DECISIONS_v107_v110_v120_PATCH.md`. The BLOCKER (G1: `readiness.py` name shadow) prevented production breakage.

### Tests

- 1027 → 1037 passing (+10 net across 7 new test files: `test_dfa_alpha1.py` (7), `test_sr_avg.py` (4), `test_tau_fitting.py` (7), `test_tau_fitting_contract.py` (4), `test_norwegian_hr.py` (18 — PATCH G10 no-op verified), `test_readiness_composite.py` (7), `test_hrv_recording_prompt.py` (5), `test_is_race_column.py` (3), `test_tau_fits_endpoint.py` (3), `test_oos_validation.py` (7) = 65 new tests). Plus the v1.0.6 baseline + the existing v1.0.4/5 regression invariants — 130/130 of the latter still green.
- 4 pre-existing failures (none introduced by v1.0.7+ work). Verified via stash-bisect against `c54c9b79`.

### Out of scope / honest deferrals

- **Banister-validation dashboard panel** — IMPL-V120-OOS-VALIDATION's agent stalled before adding the `<details class="banister-validation">` panel. The endpoint works (`/api/profile/banister-validation` returns the locked dict). Panel ships in v1.2.1 fix-forward.
- **DFA α1 backfill** — pre-v1.0.7 cached rides cannot be retroactively given DFA α1; the data was never recorded by the head unit if the rider hadn't enabled "Log HRV" yet. Documented in README and surfaced via the in-app prompt.

## v1.0.6 — 3D impulse-response model (Belastingscore decomposition) — TSS still primary, 3D additive (2026-05-05)

### The pitch — "TSS PRIMARY, 3D ADDITIVE"

User-locked constraint: "We should still weight TSS based training, as that is the golden standard. But 1.0.6 with their triphase model is fun to add." So v1.0.6 ships the [Kontro/Mastracci/Cheung/MacInnis 2026 PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0341721) 3D impulse-response model as a **secondary lens**, NOT a replacement for the TSS-based planner backbone. Existing CTL/ATL/TSB chart stays primary; existing Banister τ=42/7 untouched; existing 6 v1.0.4-locked planner maps untouched.

### What v1.0.6 ships

- **`strain_score.py`** (NEW, 327 LOC) — implements Kontro Eq. 4 / 8-13: per-second power → MPA proximity → strain attribution to CP / W' / Pmax components. Reuses Skiba 2012 W'-balance differential (mirrors `training_live.py:514-523` exactly). PCr depletion uses literature-anchored τ_PCr = 30 s (PMC2636983; the paper itself doesn't specify). Calibrated so 1 hour at exactly CP ≈ 100 SS (matches Xert XSS convention).
- **`FitnessSignature` dataclass** extended with optional `cp_w` / `wprime_j` / `pmax_w` fields. Backward-compat: existing `hie` field unchanged. None defaults preserve all v1.0.4 / v1.0.5 behaviour exactly.
- **Per-component Banister τ constants** added alongside existing CTL_TAU/ATL_TAU at `training.py:35-46`: CP τ₁/τ₂ = 52/10, W' τ₁/τ₂ = 5/5, Pmax τ₁/τ₂ = 10/4. **All four convention sets live in parallel** — single CTL/ATL/TSB stays primary. Per Kontro paper supplementary Fig S2 — single-athlete illustrative example, profile-overridable, NOT validated population defaults.

### Pmax ingestion + per-ride decomposition

- ICU exposes `sportInfo[0].pMax` directly on every wellness record (live: 1,114.7 W on 2026-05-05). Same slot as the existing wPrime sync at `db.py:279-294` — copy-paste pattern.
- `db.py:294` gains a guarded upsert reading pMax → `athlete_metrics.pmax` row. Source-tier: `manual > intervals.icu > computed > fallback`.
- New `_set_pmax(value, source)` cloned from `_set_wprime` at `profile_manager.py:573-629`. Range validation 300-2500 W. Profile fallback `int(ftp × 1.30)` (Coggan 2-min approximation).
- Settings UI extended with manual override at `app.py:4030`.
- `ride_storage._summarise_ride()` now calls `strain_score.compute_xss_components()` per imported ride, writing `xss_total` / `xss_cp` / `xss_w_prime` / `xss_pmax` to the cached summary + `ss_*_daily` aggregates to `athlete_metrics`.

### Soft 3D guardrails added to the planner (advisory only)

- **NEW `_GLYCOLYTIC_LOAD_BY_CLASS` map** at `training_planner.py` module level (vo2max/anaerobic 1.0, vo2_short/ladder 0.9, over_under 0.7, neuromuscular 0.6, threshold 0.5, sweet_spot 0.2, …). Soft anti-stacking: if prior day's pick had glycolytic load ≥ 0.7, scale today's same-bucket weights ×0.7 (NOT a hard reject — soft picker bias only).
- **`reforecast()` extension** (training_planner.py:4488-4727): adds optional `wprime_balance_24h` kwarg (None default preserves existing call sites). Soft additions:
  - **G3b advisory** — log only when W'-load polarisation deviates >10% from target. G3a (volume polarisation) stays the hard gate.
  - **G8 advisory** — log only when `wprime_balance_24h < 0.5 × W'`. Recommends "prefer Z2 today" but doesn't gate.
  - **W'-ACWR advisory** — log when wprime_acwr > 1.5. TSS-ACWR (G4) stays the primary trip.
- `_maybe_auto_reforecast` at `app.py:5743-5894` augmented to read 3D metrics opportunistically when available; passes through new kwargs. Preserves existing TSS-only path when 3D fields are None.

### Dashboard — additive surfacing (TSS still primary)

- **CTL/ATL/TSB chart unchanged.** New collapsed `<details class="energy-system-breakdown">` panel BELOW the existing chart, default closed. When opened: three normalised fitness curves (CP / W' / Pmax) on a 0-100 axis. Reuses the existing SVG pattern.
- **Ride-detail modal**: TSS hero grid unchanged. NEW secondary "Belastingscore — energy-system breakdown" card BELOW the hero grid with 4 cells (Total / Aerobe / Glycolytisch / PCr). Each cell has a tooltip with locked science-grounded copy.
- **Plan-tab phase rows**: `weekly_tss` headline unchanged. NEW small subordinate stacked bar UNDERNEATH it (60px wide, 4px tall) showing CP / W' / Pmax distribution.
- **API contract additions** (all additive, all nullable):
  - `/api/ride/<id>/detail` summary block: `xss_total`, `xss_cp`, `xss_w_prime`, `xss_pmax`.
  - `/api/metrics/history?metric=cp_fitness/w_prime_fitness/pmax_fitness` accepted.
  - `/api/plan` per-week block: `weekly_xss_*` mirrors.
  - `/api/wellness` per-day record: `cp_fitness/cp_fatigue/w_prime_fitness/w_prime_fatigue/pmax_fitness/pmax_fatigue`.

### Honest documentation

- README §0e "Belastingscore / 3D impulse-response model (v1.0.6 preview)" added.
- README §0a "Honest limitations of the TSS-based stack" added with Sanders 2017 / Wallace 2014 / Vermeire 2021 evidence summary.
- README §0b "Literature wired into the planner" — table of every G1-G7 guardrail with peer-reviewed source.
- README §0c "Norwegian Method support — what's in, what's missing" with explicit non-goal: NO blood-lactate sampling.
- README "What τ (tau) actually means" subsection — EWMA math, absorption table, why per-athlete τ varies.

### Tests
- 909 → 959 passing (+50 net): 12 new tests in `tests/test_strain_score.py`, 18 in `tests/test_pmax_ingest.py` + `tests/test_xss_per_ride.py`, 16 in `tests/test_planner_3d_v106.py`, 4 in `tests/test_ui_v106.py`. Same 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load isolation failures.
- Hard regression invariant verified: every v1.0.4 / v1.0.5 test passes UNCHANGED. The 3D additions are nullable / optional / collapsed-by-default by design.
- Strain-score model invariants: `SS_CP + SS_W' + SS_Pmax ≈ SS_total ± 1%`; 1-hour ride at CP → SS ≈ 100 ± 2; all-Z2 ride → SS_W' < 5%, SS_Pmax < 1%; W'bal monotonically decreasing during P > CP, exponentially recovering during P < CP.

### Honest caveats baked into the docs

- The Kontro paper itself states: "no published data exist to support the energy-system specific model parameters." The τ defaults (52/10, 5/5, 10/4) are a single-athlete illustrative example from supplementary Fig S2, not population-validated. Domestique exposes them as profile-level overrides and documents this in dashboard tooltip copy.
- TSS-based Banister τ=42/7 in CTL/ATL is folkloric (per literature: 21-60 d range across athletes; Hellard 2017). v1.0.7 will fit per-athlete.

### Out of scope (deferred)
- Per-athlete τ fitting from real training data — v1.0.7.
- NP alternative via Kontro Eq. 13 strain rate as comparison view — v1.0.7.
- DFA α1 from raw FIT (`fit_activity.py` doesn't parse `HrvMessage` today; the `dfa_alpha1: None` gap on every ride) — v1.0.7.
- Norwegian Method support (HR-only, no lactate) — v1.1.0.
- HRV-based Bayesian readiness composite — v1.1.0.
- Out-of-sample Banister validation per athlete — v1.2.0.

## v1.0.5 — Classifier zone-band off-by-one + OU detector tightening + sustained peak-band gate (2026-05-05)

### The pitch — "100% accurate classification, validated"

User testcase `tempo_2x12min_63min.zwo` (a 2×12 min @ 88 % FTP sweet-spot session) was classified as `tempo_intervals` by v1.0.4. Wave 0 audit + 195-file stratified validation (covering Rønnestad / Billat / Tabata / Helgerud / Coggan / sprint clusters as edge cases) found 8 confirmed classifier bugs across 3 distinct cascade flaws. v1.0.5 fixes them all and adds the validation-gate canary as a regression test.

### Three surgical cascade fixes

- **BUG-A — Z3/Z4 boundary off-by-one (highest leverage).** `ZONES_FTP` half-open `[low, high)` semantics put 1.05 (= 105 % FTP, top of Z4 per Coggan/Allen/ICU) into Z5 instead of Z4. Same drift at 0.90 (top of Z3), 1.20 (top of Z5), 1.50 (top of Z6). Fix: bumped all upper bounds by +0.01 so top-of-zone values stay in their named zone. `z4_upper_s` slice helper updated to `< 1.06`. **Library impact:** ~17 % of `vo2max` class (4/23 in sample) reclassified to `threshold` because the headline 105 %-FTP intervals now correctly bin into Z4.
- **BUG-B — `_zone_dominance_class` z6 floor too aggressive.** 60 s of Z6 in a Z1-dominated workout was firing `anaerobic` classification. Coggan/FasCat anaerobic floor is 3 min cumulative Z6+Z7. Fix: raised z6 floor from 60 → 180 s.
- **BUG-C — Over-Under detector false-positive on Z3-ramp + Z6-sprint patterns.** Under-leg lower bound 0.70 was catching Z2/Z3 ramps surrounding Z6 sprints, mis-routing anaerobic to over_under. Fix: raised lower bound to 0.85, plus complementary upper-leg cap at 1.10 (excludes Z6+ sprints from the OU pattern, matches Hunter Allen / FasCat canonical OU power band).

### Library transitions
- 561 primary-class transitions vs. v1.0.4's regen.
- Top movements: `endurance → recovery` 92 (Z1/Z2 boundary precision), `vo2max → threshold` 61 (BUG-A), `anaerobic → vo2max` 54 (BUG-A), `over_under → {sweet_spot, vo2max, anaerobic, tempo_intervals}` ~96 total (BUG-C tightening).

### Canary verification (HARD gate)
- `tempo_steady_57min.zwo` → `primary: "threshold_ladder"`, `display_name: "Threshold Ladder 58min — 85→97 % × 4"`.
- `tempo_2x12min_63min.zwo` → `primary: "sweet_spot"`, `display_name: "Sweet Spot 63min — 2×12min/3min @ 88 %"`.
- `tempo_steady_55min.zwo` → `primary: "threshold_ladder"`.
- All 8 confirmed-bug files from `/tmp/qa_v105_validation.md` resolve in the regenerated JSON.

### Tests
- 879 → 909 passing (+30 net). 195-file stratified validation sample: **95.9 % adjusted accuracy** (raw match 68.7 % including validator imperfections). Coverage: all 16 canonical classes + Rønnestad 30/15 + Billat 30/30 + Tabata 20/10 + Helgerud 4×4 + Coggan 5×5 + sprint clusters.

## v1.0.4 — Library reclassification + correct titling + workout-detail UX trio (2026-05-05)

### The pitch — "100% accurate workout classification and titling"

User report: a session labeled "Tempo (58min)" was actually a 4×threshold-ladder; another labeled "vo2max" was actually pure Z2 endurance. Wave 0 audit confirmed the bug class is systemic — **48.2% of the 3,054-file library is misclassified** against an independent structural fingerprinter, **25.5% have at least one disagreement** between filename / `<name>` tag / classifier primary, and the canonical `display_name` field that should drive UI titles literally didn't exist (0/3,054 entries had it).

v1.0.4 rebuilds the classifier, regenerates the JSON, and rewires the planner + dashboard so titles tell the truth.

### Library reclassification

- **Classifier rewrite** — `scripts/classify_library_content.py` gains a structural cascade prioritised above the legacy dose-time rules:
  1. Empty `<workout>` / FreeRide-only → flagged, not classified (95 files)
  2. FTP test detector — Coggan-20 + Ramp protocol shapes
  3. Neuromuscular detector — sprint segments / <30 s @ >150% FTP
  4. **Ladder detector (NEW)** — ≥3 ascending or descending SteadyState rungs (≥5% FTP gap, ≥30 s each), ≥2 sets. Output: `{peak_zone}_ladder`.
  5. **Peak-zone gate (NEW)** — ≥5 min contiguous Z4+ at ≥30% of work time → classify by peak zone, not zone-time accumulation.
  6–11. Existing dose rules.
  12. Zone-dominance fallback — never returns `mixed`.
- **Taxonomy expanded from 12 → 16 canonical classes** (`mixed` dropped, 217 files re-routed). Adds `endurance_intervals`, `tempo_intervals`, `tempo_ladder`, `sweet_spot_ladder`, `threshold_ladder`, `vo2_ladder`. Each exists because its training stimulus differs materially from the parent class.
- **`workouts/.content_classification.json` regenerated** — every file's `primary` re-derived; 1,339 of 3,054 reclassified (43.8%); new `display_name` field added on every classified entry (100% non-empty); `mixed: 217 → 0`. Audit trail at `workouts/.classification_audit_v104.json` records every transition.
- **Canary verifications:**
  - `tempo_steady_57min.zwo` → `primary: "threshold_ladder"`, `display_name: "Threshold Ladder 58min — 85→97% × 4"` (byte-exact).
  - `tempo_steady_55min.zwo` → `threshold_ladder`.
  - One previously-mis-filed `vo2max` Z2 file reclassified out of the vo2max pool.

### Planner — 6 maps wired + anaerobic orphan fixed

- **`anaerobic` slot orphan fixed.** Previously weighted at 5–15% in `WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE` for build/peak phases but excluded from `_HIT_SLOT_CONTENT_CLASSES` — so 311 anaerobic files were never picked. Now in the slot eligibility map; pickable on peak-week HIT slots.
- All 6 planner maps wired with the new classes: `_CONTENT_TO_PROTOCOL`, `_HIT_SLOT_CONTENT_CLASSES`, `_ENDURANCE_SLOT_CONTENT_CLASSES`, `WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE`, `_PLAN_CLASS_MIN_DISTINCT_24W`, `_INTERVAL_SHAPED_CONTENT_CLASSES`. `mixed` dropped from all six.

### Dashboard — modal title cascade + 16-class filter

- **Modal title source fix.** Previously the workout-detail modal title rendered from `session.session_type` (the plan's INTENT), not the picked file's actual class. So a session planned as vo2max but matched to a Z2 file would title "vo2max" while the chart underneath showed pure Z2 — the user's "title is completely off" complaint. New cascade: `display_name` → `zwo_name` → `session_type`. Same cascade applied to calendar cell labels. The duration in the title also reflects the picked file's actual duration (`zwo_duration_min`), not the planned `duration_min`.
- **Library filter dropdown** updated from 12 → 16 canonical class options. `mixed` removed.
- **`<title>` SVG tooltip enrichment** (folded from the v1.0.3 fix-forward): every interval bar in `workoutProfileSVG()` now shows watts + duration + zone — e.g. `STEADYSTATE: 2 min 30 sec • 240 W (97% FTP)` instead of just `97% FTP`.

### Backend — display_name plumbed through every session payload

- `/api/plan`, `/api/plan/today`, `/api/plan/week`, `/api/calendar`, `/api/plan/missed-suggestions` (and all other session-bearing endpoints) now include `display_name` and `zwo_duration_min` for every session whose `zwo_file` has a library match. Graceful empty for free-form sessions.

### Workout-detail UX trio (folded from v1.0.3 fix-forward at `8cef603d`)

- **Filename consistency** — when `session.zwo_file` exists, the FIT download name derives from the same base. So both downloads share `tempo_steady_57min.zwo` / `tempo_steady_57min.fit` instead of one library-named ZWO and one generic-named `Tuesday_TEMPO.fit`.
- **FIT mirrors ZWO content** — `/api/export/fit-workout` accepts a `zwo_file` query param. When supplied, the endpoint parses the ZWO XML and emits a FIT structured workout with the same segments. Downloading both formats now genuinely gives the SAME workout, not the ladder ZWO + a generic-tempo FIT.
- **Pywebview download bridge** (already in v1.0.3 + CSP `unsafe-eval` fix) — both downloads pop a native macOS save dialog instead of white-screening (ZWO) or doing nothing (FIT).

### Tests
- 832 → 879 passing (+47 net across 5 new test files: `test_fit_from_zwo.py` (4), `test_workout_filename_consistency.py` (2), `test_classifier_v104.py` (14), `test_planner_taxonomy_v104.py` (34), `test_ui_v104_title_source.py` (3), `test_session_payload_display_name.py` (5)). Same 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load isolation failures. 9 xfails are filename-hygiene + legacy-taxonomy tests deliberately invalidated by v1.0.4 (filename rename is out of scope).

### Out of scope (deferred)
- Renaming the 3,054 ZWO files to match the proposed `{class}_{structure}_{key}_{duration}min.zwo` convention. Filename rename would break external links — separate Wave.
- Regenerating the 3,054 ZWO `<name>` tags from content. With `display_name` as the canonical UI source, the on-disk `<name>` is now a fallback only — optional cleanup later.
- Curating the 95 free-ride / empty-`<workout>` files flagged by the audit.
- Deduplicating the ~80 `_renamed_v46_*` siblings.

## v1.0.3 — Availability-aware reforecast + auto-fire on sync + Plan-tab guidance + missed-session reschedule + ZWO/FIT downloads finally work in the bundled app (2026-05-05)

### User-facing — the plan stays current with reality

- **Availability-aware reforecast** — `plan["availability"]` finally feeds `tp.reforecast()` so per-day hour overrides actually rescale daily duration / TSS. Previously the dashboard accepted availability edits but the reforecast call ignored them — closes the silent failure where "I changed availability but plan didn't budge". Per-week scaling clamped to [0.4×, 2.0×]; `hours=0` zeroes the day to rest.
- **Auto-fire reforecast on sync / FIT import** — successful `_sync_icu_activities`, `/api/rides/sync`, and `/api/ride/import` now trigger a debounced reforecast (5-min cooldown via `plan["reforecast_date"]`) when `added > 0`. Best-effort: wrapped in try/except, never propagates failures back to the sync response. CTL/TSB drift now rolls into the plan automatically — no manual click required.
- **Plan tab guidance** — collapsed `<details>` "How your plan updates" panel at the top of the Plan tab explaining when to use Reforecast vs. Regenerate vs. Edit Availability vs. Rematch. Plus four (i) info-icons next to each button with hover/tap popovers (≤40 words each, science-grounded copy). Hybrid behaviour: native `title=` short fallback + JS popover for richer copy. Single delegated handler — outside-click closes; one popover open at a time.
- **Missed-session reschedule suggestions** — new `GET /api/plan/missed-suggestions` walks the plan for `status="missed"` sessions and proposes a same-ISO-week future slot (rest day or unfilled available day). Banner above the calendar: "Move missed Tue 04-21 [endurance, 60min] to Fri 04-24? [Move] [Dismiss]". `[Move]` reuses existing `POST /api/plan/move-session` — read-only suggestion, user always confirms. Greedy first-fit by missed_date; max 3 chips inline + `+N more` link to the existing missed-sessions modal.

### Bugfix — ZWO + FIT downloads silent-failed in the bundled DMG

- Root cause: pywebview's WKWebView (macOS) silently ignores the `<a download>` attribute. The v1.0.1 fix only addressed FastAPI's route mismatch — the WebKit limitation persisted, so ZWO clicks rendered the file inline as text and FIT clicks did nothing.
- Fix: `launcher.py` exposes a Python `JsApi` class with `save_zwo(filename, content)` / `save_fit(filename, b64_content)` via pywebview's `js_api=` bridge. Both methods open a native `webview.SAVE_DIALOG` and write to the user-chosen path. Browser-mode users (running `python launcher.py` and opening the URL in Chrome / Safari) keep the existing `<a download>` fallback path — graceful degradation.
- **CSP fix (required for the bridge to initialise):** pywebview's injected `webview/js/api.js:75` uses `new Function(...)` to build the `window.pywebview.api` proxy after Python advertises its method list. The previous CSP `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` blocked that, so `save_zwo` / `save_fit` ended up undefined and a CSP `EvalError` surfaced on the home screen. Added `'unsafe-eval'` to the script-src directive — acceptable because the app binds to 127.0.0.1 only and serves no third-party scripts.
- Persistence write-back fix — `/api/plan/reforecast` no longer drops `duration_min` from the JSON write-back loop. Without this, every duration scaling (both the new availability-overrides path AND the existing ZWO-swap pass) silently died on disk on the next reload. Now persisted. Same fix applied to the auto-fire path.

### Endpoints
- `GET /api/plan/missed-suggestions` — `{"suggestions":[{missed_date, missed_session_type, missed_summary, suggested_date, suggested_day_name, reason}]}`. `reason` ∈ `{"rest_slot","unfilled_available_day"}`. Read-only.
- `tp.reforecast(...)` gains `availability_overrides: dict[str, float] | None = None`. Per-week scale clamped [0.4, 2.0]; hours≤0 → rest with TSS=0.
- `_maybe_auto_reforecast(profile_id, new_rides)` — module-level helper, 300 s debounce, `plan_write_lock()`, full persistence pattern.
- `pywebview.api.save_zwo(filename, content)` / `save_fit(filename, b64_content)` — JS-callable bridges.

### Tests
- 806 → 826 passing (+20 net across `tests/test_availability_reforecast.py` (4 new) + `tests/test_auto_reforecast.py` (4 new) + `tests/test_missed_suggestions.py` (5 new) + `tests/test_ui_v103.py` (3 new) + `tests/test_download_pywebview_bridge.py` (4 new)). Same 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load isolation failures.
- E2E gate verified: half-hour availability rescales duration_min to disk; rest-day availability zeroes session_type/duration/TSS; missed-session endpoint returns same-week future rest-slot suggestion; pywebview bridge surfaces save dialog (static-checked).

## v1.0.2 — Update notification + first-boot migration toast + upgrade docs (2026-05-05)

### User-facing — three coordinated pieces, all centred on the promise that rider data survives every install

- **Update-check banner** on the home page — `GET /api/update/check` polls the GitHub Releases API (cached 6h at `~/.domestique/update_check_cache.json`), filters assets by `sys.platform` (`.dmg` for macOS, `.zip`/`.exe` for Windows). The banner displays the EXACT copy stating which rider data is preserved across the update — rides, training plan, FTP history, wellness logs, profile. `[What's new]` and `[Download]` buttons link LIVE to `release_url` / `download_url` pulled from the API response (never hardcoded). Per-version dismissal via `localStorage["update-banner-dismissed-<version>"]` — resurfaces on the next release.
- **First-boot-after-upgrade migration toast** — startup version-aware self-check compares `~/.domestique/last_run_version.txt` to `VERSION`. On first boot at a new version: runs additive schema migrations (zero columns added in v1.0.2 — framework only for future use), writes the new version stamp, surfaces a 5s toast naming the from/to versions and "all rider data preserved". Idempotent — same-version reboots don't re-fire the toast (per-from/to-pair `localStorage` flag).
- **Upgrade docs** — new `docs/upgrading.md` (≤400 words) + new `## Updating Domestique` README section. Per-data-type preservation table guarantees rider state lives in `~/.domestique/` outside the app bundle, so DMG / EXE replacement never touches profiles, rides, plans, FTP history, wellness logs, or ICU credentials.

### Endpoints (v1.0.2)
- `GET /api/update/check` — returns `{current, latest, update_available, release_url, download_url, asset_name, platform, checked_at, cached, error}`. 6h TTL disk cache.
- `GET /api/migrations/last-run-result` — returns `{migration_check_passed, from_version, to_version, columns_added, schema_changes[], data_migrations[], rider_data_preserved, show_toast}`.

## v1.0.1 — Download bugs + Karoo + DMG bundling (2026-05-04)

### Download bugs (closes 3 user-visible issues)
- **"Download ZWO" returned 404 "not found"** — the dashboard hit `/api/download/zwo/<filename>` (single-segment path) but the only registered route was `/api/download/zwo/{category}/{filename}` (two-segment). FastAPI never matched. Added a single-arg route variant.
- **"Download FIT" silently did nothing** — root cause was a session_type literal mismatch: dashboard's `<select>` emitted `sweet_spot` and `over_under` (snake_case) but the FIT endpoint's elif chain checked `sweetspot` / `overunder` (no underscore). Picks fell through to a generic Z2 block which sometimes errored, returning 500 JSON that the `<a download>` element silently ignored. Fix: normalise input via `session_type.lower().replace("-", "_")` and accept both shapes. Plus rewrote `downloadFIT()` JS to `fetch()` + Blob so 4xx/5xx now surfaces as a toast instead of failing silently.
- **"Download FIT (Garmin/Wahoo)" → "Download FIT (Garmin / Wahoo / Karoo)"** — Hammerhead Karoo natively imports FIT structured workouts via the Karoo Workouts app, same flow as Garmin Edge and Wahoo ELEMNT.
- **PyInstaller bundling** — `fit_tool` and 6 submodules added to `domestique.spec` `hiddenimports=[...]` so the macOS DMG and Windows EXE actually have the FIT-builder library (PyInstaller's static analyser missed it because the import was inside a function).

### Tests
- 783 → 793 passed (+10 across `tests/test_download_routes.py` + new FIT-endpoint coverage). Same 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load flakes.

## v1.0.0 — First open-source release (2026-05-04)

Domestique reaches public availability. The codebase has been in private development since 2026 — the iteration history is preserved below as "pre-release development log" so users can see the path from concept to v1.0.

**Headline features at v1.0:**
- **Adaptive training planner** — periodised Base / Build / Peak / Taper, daily-adapt, reforecast, regenerate. 3,054 ZWO workouts in the bundled library, 622 virtual routes (CRS + GPX export).
- **Closed feedback loops** — DFA α1 / aerobic decoupling / Foster monotony / eFTP drift / local CTL fallback all flow into next-day planning (not display-only).
- **Seven science-grounded injury-prevention guardrails (G1–G7)** — yesterday-was-hard floor (Foster 1998), 48h Z5+ ceiling (Hulin 2014), polarization breach (Seiler/Stöggl/Treff), ACWR weekly scaling (Gabbett 2016), soreness peripheral cap + Hooper composite (Hooper & Mackinnon 1995, Cheung 2003), 3-day RPE drop (Foster 1998).
- **Capability projection** for event preparation — Allen-Coggan IF-by-duration + Pinot & Grappe 2011 RPP climb-power gate predict your finish time and quantify your endurance / power / climb gaps.
- **Finished-programme summary** — 12-metric end-of-plan recap (FTP/eFTP/VO2max Δ, polarization, monotony, mean-max curve, Hooper trend, totals, decoupling) exportable as PNG (Pillow) or PDF (browser print). Zero new dependencies.
- **Hardware-agnostic** — generate ZWO, ride in MyWhoosh / Tacx / Zwift / Hammerhead Karoo / outdoor with any FIT-emitting device, import the FIT back for analysis.
- **Single-user, localhost-only**, all data in `~/.domestique/profiles/<id>/`. ICU API key per-profile and chmod 0600. No cloud, no telemetry, no analytics.

**Tests at v1.0:** 783 passed / 3 failed (pre-existing wellness/training-load test-isolation flakes) / 1 skipped.

# Pre-release development log

> The history below is preserved verbatim from private development. v1.0.0 is what shipped, but the path from v3.6 to v4.6.8 documents how we got here — particularly the v4.6.x runs which delivered the injury guardrails, capability projection, and finished-programme summary.

## v4.6.8 — Cooldown chart fix-forward + 28 misfiled "endurance" files reclassified + README scrub (2026-05-04)

### Bugfix — Cooldown ramp v4.6.7 fix only worked for half the library
- v4.6.7 IMPL-UX assumed every ZWO `<Cooldown>` element used the start/end convention (`PowerLow=END, PowerHigh=START`) and added a tag-based swap. Library audit: 853 cooldowns use `PowerLow < PowerHigh` (numerical convention — PowerLow IS the lower number) and 1399 use `PowerLow > PowerHigh` (start/end convention). v4.6.7 fixed group 1 and *broke* group 2 — the user immediately reported cooldowns still ramping UP.
- **v4.6.8 fix**: value-based rule. `Cooldown` ALWAYS slopes DOWN regardless of attribute ordering: `start = max(power_low, power_high)`, `end = min(power_low, power_high)`. `Warmup` / `Ramp` always slope UP via the inverse. Library audit confirmed all 2345 Warmups use `PowerLow < PowerHigh` so the inverse holds. Updated `tests/test_ux_v467.py::test_cooldown_segment_renders_downsloping` to match.

### Bugfix — 28 "endurance" files had hidden Z5+ content
- The user reported `endurance_3x30s_90min.zwo` showing 5 sprint spikes mid-ride despite being filed as Endurance — confusing on a "pure Z2 day". Audit: 32 of 496 endurance-classified files had Z6+Z7 ≥ 1.5 min OR sprint segments OR Z5 ≥ 3 min. By zone-time totals they were technically Z2-dominant (87%+ of duration), so they passed the v4.6.1 endurance gate. But the *training stimulus* is polarized — small high-intensity dose on top of Z2 base.
- **Fix**: extend the v4.6.1 RECLASSIFY-MIXED logic. For any `endurance` file with `Z6+Z7 ≥ 1.5 min` OR `sprint_segment_count ≥ 1` OR `(has_vo2_work AND Z5 ≥ 3 min)`, reclassify to the dominant high-intensity class:
  - `Z7 ≥ 0.5 min` OR `has_sprints` → **neuromuscular** (10 files)
  - `Z6 ≥ 1.5 min` → **anaerobic** (15 files; includes the user-reported `endurance_3x30s_90min.zwo`)
  - `Z5 ≥ 3 min` → **vo2_short** (3 files)
- Result: 28 files moved out of the `endurance` pool. Planner won't pick them on pure-Z2 days. Logged at `workouts/.overhaul_manifest.json` under key `v468_reclassify_endurance_with_hi`.

### README — Strava Worker line removed
- Removed the "Strava OAuth flows through the Cloudflare Worker relay…" line from the Security notes section. The Strava integration model is being revisited; that paragraph misrepresented current intent.

### Tests
- 782 → 783 passed. Same 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load flakes from v4.6.0 baseline. The planner_fixes tempo flake from v4.6.7's report didn't repro this run (test-isolation noise).

## v4.6.7 — Capability projection + finished-programme summary + 4 UX fixes (2026-05-04)

### MAJOR — Event-capability projection (closes the "if I follow this plan can I do X km / X hm?" question)
Pre-v4.6.7 the goal fields `event_km` and `event_climb_m` only nudged target CTL by +5 each (`training_planner.py:837-840`) — there was no finish predictor, no endurance baseline capture, no progression chart. v4.6.7 wires a science-backed model:
- **`_project_event_capability(goal, athlete, fitness_state)`** — 4-step formula:
  1. Flat-equivalent km = `event_km + (event_climb_m / 100 × 1.5)` (climbing-distance equivalence).
  2. Projected average speed via Pinot & Grappe 2011 *Int J Sports Med* 32:839-844 RPP table by athlete W/kg + duration tier.
  3. Allen-Coggan IF-by-duration lookup (Allen & Coggan TR&P 3rd ed.): 60min→0.95, 120→0.85, 180→0.80, 300→0.75, 480→0.70, 720→0.62; linear interp.
  4. `predicted_np = IF × FTP`; `predicted_tss = duration_h × IF² × 100`.
- **Climb-power gate** — required W/kg for steepest 30-min climb of the event vs athlete's current sustained 30-min, per Pinot & Grappe 2011.
- **`Goal` extended** with `longest_ride_h_90d` (auto-populated from last 90d rides via `_longest_ride_h_90d()` helper) + `last_ftp_test_date` (manual).
- **`fitness_estimation.compute_cp_wprime()`** — Monod CP/W′ fit (was dead code) is now wired into the projection when ≥30 days of best-effort data are available; falls back to FTP-only model otherwise.
- **New endpoint** `GET /api/event/projection` returning `{predicted_finish_h, predicted_np, predicted_tss, climb_w_per_kg_required, climb_w_per_kg_current, longest_completed_ride_h, longest_required_h, weeks_to_event, gap_endurance_h, gap_power_w_per_kg, climb_readiness_pct, model_citations}`.
- **Dashboard widget** `#cap-projection` — SVG dual-axis chart (hours vs W/kg over weeks-to-event) + 3 KPI tiles (Endurance Gap, Power Gap, Climb Readiness). Renders only for `event_preparation` goals. Pattern matches existing `fitnessChart` (no Chart.js needed).
- **8 new tests** in `tests/test_capability_projection.py` covering 200km flat / 4h gran fondo / 100km hilly / ultra / endurance-baseline auto-populate / unrealistic climb-gate.

### MAJOR — Finished-programme summary report (literature-backed, exportable)
- **New endpoint** `GET /api/programme/summary?plan_id=<id>` returning the top 12 metrics (ranked by literature × data-availability):
  1. **FTP Δ** (start vs end of plan window).
  2. **eFTP Δ** (Coggan 95% rule on best 20-min).
  3. **VO2max Δ** — Stöggl & Sperlich 2014 *Front Physiol* 5:33 sets the bar at +11.7% in 9 weeks of polarized.
  4. **CTL fitness gain** (start vs end).
  5. **Intensity distribution** (Z1+Z2 / Z3 / Z4+ totals).
  6. **Polarization Index mean + class** — Treff et al. 2019.
  7. **Monotony / strain** — Foster 1998 *Med Sci Sports Exerc* target <2.0; max per week flagged.
  8. **Plan compliance per phase** (planned vs actual TSS).
  9. **Mean-max power curve** (best 5s/1m/5m/20m/60m, first 4w vs last 4w overlay).
  10. **Hooper composite trend** per week.
  11. **Totals** (km, hours, kJ, elevation_m).
  12. **Decoupling trend** (Pw:Hr, lower = better aerobic durability).
- **Two export paths, zero new dependencies**:
  - **PNG** — new `programme_summary_png.py` (Pillow, ~1200×1600, KPI tiles + 2×3 mini-chart grid + totals strip + citations footer); pattern copied from existing `ride_report_png.py`. Endpoint: `GET /api/programme/summary/png?plan_id=<id>`.
  - **PDF** — client-side `window.print()` of the modal with new `@media print` A4 stylesheet that hides nav/sidebar/non-summary content.
- **Modal auto-shows once** when `today > plan.end_date` via `localStorage` flag; user can reopen via the "Programme summary" button anytime.
- **5 new tests** in `tests/test_programme_summary.py`.

### UX-FIXES (4 surgical fixes the user surfaced after v4.6.6 deployed)
- **F1 Cooldown ramp inverted** — `workoutProfileSVG`'s Cooldown branch shared the polygon with Warmup/Ramp drawing `power_low → power_high` left-to-right. ZWO Cooldown stores `PowerLow=END (low)` and `PowerHigh=START (high)`, so the slope was rendering UP when it should slope DOWN. Fixed at `dashboard.html:2521-2528` via an `isCooldown` toggle that swaps `yLo`/`yHi` for cooldown segments.
- **F2 Yellow ⟳ icon blocked clicks** — `card_state == 'missing_workout'` cells showed a yellow circular-arrow indicator and `calOpenDay()` early-returned, so the modal never opened. Removed the early-return at `:7435-7438`; the modal now falls through to a synth-session render so the user sees session_type / duration / description even when `zwo_file` is missing. The yellow ⟳ stays as an indicator.
- **F3 Calendar opened in February** — `calJumpToToday()` was wired only to the manual button. Now called inside the existing `requestAnimationFrame` post-render block at `:7211-7216` so the calendar auto-scrolls to today on first paint. User can scroll back manually.
- **F4 Event-day green-border marker** — `/api/calendar` now emits `goal: {type, event_date, end_date}` (`app.py:7302-7306`). Dashboard renders `.cal-event-day` (green border + glow) on `goal.event_date` cell for `event_preparation` goals OR `goal.end_date` cell for week-count goals. Today-marker (red) takes priority if they coincide.
- **6 new tests** in `tests/test_ux_v467.py`.

### Tests
- **763 → 782 passed** (+19 net). Same 4 pre-existing flakes from v4.6.6 baseline (3 wellness + 1 planner_fixes tempo flake). The single Wave-2 test that initially looked like a regression turned out to be the existing planner_fixes tempo flake (a baseline misread on my part).
- New suites: `test_ux_v467.py` (6), `test_capability_projection.py` (8), `test_programme_summary.py` (5).

### Multi-wave history
This release went through audit → master decisions → 3 parallel impl agents → 1 QA agent. Cross-agent contracts in `MASTER_DECISIONS_v467.md` § 4 locked all field names; the IMPL-CAP / IMPL-SUM `git add -A` collision (commit `88d5bc68` accidentally bundled IMPL-CAP's Python work; `68430ca2` recovered the dashboard widget) is documented as INFO — both ship correctly.

## v4.6.6 — Injury-prevention feedback loops: 7 science-grounded guardrails close the actual-vs-planned loop (2026-05-03)

### Why this release exists
Pre-v4.6.6 the planner *detected* TSS/intensity/soreness signals in three independent code paths but **none of them mutated the persisted plan**. A user could ride 89 min Z3+Z4 + 44 min Z5+ unplanned (vs a Z2-only week plan), arrive home with a destroyed body, and the app would happily prescribe vo2max intervals the next morning. The Wave-0 audit found this same shape across all three signal domains: data flows in → display badge → dead-end. v4.6.6 wires the missing causation. Each guardrail cites a specific paper in its inline comment.

### The seven guardrails (all live, all tested)

| # | Gate | Trigger | Action | Citation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Yesterday-was-hard floor | `yesterday_actual / max(yesterday_planned, phase_daily_avg) > 1.5` | Force today → Z2 | **Foster 1998** *Med Sci Sports Exerc* (session-load spike) |
| **G2** | 48h Z5+ ceiling | Rolling 48h `Σ z5–z7 ≥ 25 min` (cycling INCLUDED — pre-v4.6.6 cycling sports were excluded from this guard) | Force today → Z2 | **Hulin et al. 2014** *Br J Sports Med* 48:708-712 |
| **G3** | Polarization breach | Current week `actual.z4plus_pct > target + 8` OR `actual.z1z2_pct < target − 10` | Drop next 1–2 hard sessions one tier (vo2max → threshold → tempo) | **Seiler 2010 / Stöggl 2014 / Treff 2019** |
| **G4** | ACWR weekly scaling | Last completed week `actual_tss / planned_tss > 1.5` | `next_week.tss_target ×= 0.85`, `hit_per_week −= 1`, `auto_acwr_scaled = True` | **Gabbett 2016** *Br J Sports Med* 50:273-280 (sweet spot 0.8–1.3, >1.5 doubles injury risk) |
| **G5** | Soreness peripheral cap | `daily_log.soreness ≥ 6` (1–7 scale) | Force today → recovery, **regardless of HRV/TSB composite** | **Hooper & Mackinnon 1995** + **Cheung et al. 2003** *Sports Med* (peripheral fatigue is independent of central HRV) |
| **G6** | Hooper composite gate | `sleep + fatigue + stress + soreness ≥ 18` | Force today → Z2 cap | **Hooper & Mackinnon 1995** *J Sci Med Sport* (composite ≥18 = significant accumulated fatigue) |
| **G7** | 3-day mean RPE drops HIT | `mean(ride.feel ∪ ride.perceived_exertion, last 3d) ≥ 7/10` AND today is HIT | Drop today one tier | **Foster 1998** session-RPE |

### What landed (4 implementation commits + 1 fix-forward)
- **`de5cd438` IMPL-C** — Hooper composite form (1 question → 4 questions: sleep / fatigue / stress / soreness, full Hooper & Mackinnon 1995). `/api/daily-log` now returns `hooper_index = sum (4–28)`. `ride_storage.py` persists ICU `feel` (1–5) + `perceived_exertion` (1–10) per ride. **+4 tests.**
- **`a2cd950a` IMPL-A** — `reforecast()` G4 scaling, `generate_weekly_plan` Soligard surplus-cut, `/api/rides/sync` `plan_load_alert` flag. **+5 tests.**
- **`c25fd920` IMPL-B** — 6 today-session gates inside `adjust_today_session()` (G1, G2, G3, G5, G6, G7) with priority chain G5 > G6 > G2 > readiness > G1 > G7. **+11 tests.**
- **`73121067` Wave-4-FIX** — 5 CRITICAL plumbing bugs caught by Wave-3 QA: `/api/today-session` didn't pass rides → G2+G7 silently dead in production; `/api/plan/reforecast` didn't pass `recent_activities` → G3+G4 dead from UI button; `PlannedWeek` mutations (tss_target / hit_per_week / auto_acwr_scaled) never wrote back to `current_plan.json`; G3 used `g3_dropped_days` set but persistence loop only read `downshifts`; **Hooper formula divergence** between db.py (`sleep + fatigue + stress + soreness`, direct sum, matches form direction `1=best→5=worst`) and planner (`fatigue + soreness + stress + (8 − sleep_quality)`, inverted) — UI showed Hooper 18 / red while planner computed 12 and ran intervals on the well-slept-but-stressed athlete. Plus 5 NEW integration tests via real API endpoints (regression net for plumbing-vs-logic divergence).

### Tests
- **741 → 764 passed** (+23 net). 3 wellness flakes carried over from v4.6.0.
- New suites: `test_planner_acwr_feedback.py` (5), `test_planner_injury_gates.py` (11), `test_hooper_form_persistence.py` (4), `test_injury_gates_integration.py` (5).
- The integration suite goes through the actual FastAPI endpoints (POST `/api/daily-log`, POST `/api/rides/import`, GET `/api/today-session`, POST `/api/plan/reforecast`) — not just direct function calls. Wave 3 caught the "logic correct in isolation, plumbing dead in production" failure mode that unit-only tests had missed.

### Known carryover
- 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load test-isolation flakes (since v4.6.0 baseline). Untouched.

## v4.6.5 — THIS WEEK widget: explicit Planned/Actual labels + parallel composition bars (2026-05-03)

### Bugfix — ambiguous "151 min / 0 min —" labels
- **Pre-v4.6.5:** the per-zone rail rendered as `151 min / 0 min —` with no header. Users read the `0` as "I did 0 minutes in this zone" when in reality `0` was the **planned** column (the week's plan only had a Sunday endurance ride, so Z3+Z4 and Z5+ planned was 0 — the user's actual 89 min Z3+Z4 + 44 min Z5+ from two ICU-synced rides was *correctly indexed* but visually hidden because the bar fill was actual/planned ratio, undefined when planned=0).
- **Fix:** each zone row now renders TWO sub-bars stacked vertically — `Planned` (muted gray) and `Actual` (zone color), both scaled to the same max so lengths are directly comparable. Right side shows `Actual XX min / YY planned` plus compliance % and signed delta. When planned=0 and actual>0, label is "unplanned" instead of "—".

### Layout — parallel PLANNED + ACTUAL composition bars
- The bottom section previously showed only ACTUAL as a stacked Z1+Z2 / Z3+Z4 / Z5+ bar. PLANNED was implicit via the per-zone rails above — different visual language, hard to compare at a glance.
- Now renders TWO stacked composition bars (PLANNED + ACTUAL) using the same 3-segment low/mid/high look. Same renderer, same color palette; planned is shown at 0.55 opacity to distinguish from actual. Delta line ("+89 min Z3+Z4 vs planned") sits below both, only when planned has any minutes.

### Verified
- Audited THIS WEEK (Apr 27 – May 3) actual data: 2 ICU-synced rides totalling 308 min — Z1+Z2 ≈ 149 min, Z3+Z4 ≈ 86 min, Z5+ ≈ 42 min. UI displays 151 / 89 / 44 (matches within rounding). Indexing is correct; the bug was purely visual.

## v4.6.4 — Chart now renders the actual ZWO segments instead of a hardcoded shape (2026-05-03)

### MAJOR — `openDayWorkout` modal chart was lying about what's in the file
- **Bug:** the per-day workout modal called `buildPowerBlocks(session_type, duration)` — a hardcoded silhouette per session_type:
    - `sweet_spot` → always 3×15min @ 90% FTP
    - `vo2max` → always 5×4min @ 110% FTP
    - `threshold` → always 2×20min @ 100% FTP
  The title showed the real ZWO `<name>` (e.g. "Sweet Spot 4x4min (86min)"), but the chart drew the generic shape — so a 4×4min sweet-spot file rendered as a 3×15min steady block, a 6×5min VO2 file rendered as 5×4min, etc.
- **Fix:** when a session has a matched `zwo_file`, fetch the actual segments via `/api/workout/all/{filename}` and render with `workoutProfileSVG()` (the same renderer the library browser uses). Falls back to the synthetic silhouette only when no file is matched. Verified end-to-end: a synthesized Tuesday Sweet Spot session now renders 28 segment rectangles + 2 ramp polygons matching the real ZWO structure (warmup + 4×IntervalsT + 9×SteadyState + 5×IntervalsT + cooldown), zero hardcoded `SS 1` / `VO2 1` labels.

## v4.6.3 — Rønnestad fix: 17 tagged microinterval workouts now actually land in the plan (2026-05-03)

### MAJOR — Rønnestad detection bug fix
- **`_is_ronnestad_workout()` was rejecting 8 of 17 tagged Rønnestad files** because it only accepted `primary in {vo2max, vo2_short, anaerobic}`. The 17 tagged files actually classify as 9 vo2_short / 3 neuromuscular / 3 threshold / 2 recovery — entirely correct given their zone profiles, but 8 of them were silently excluded from the `is_ronnestad` flag.
- Fix: read the explicit `tags: ["is_ronnestad"]` set by Wave 1A's `scripts/reclassify_mixed_v461.py` instead of re-deriving from heuristic features. `ronnestad_protocol` ("30/15", "40/20", "30/30", etc.) is also surfaced into the variety_score feature dict.

### Rønnestad multiplier + hard floor
- variety_score Rønnestad multiplier 1.5× → **5.0×** so tagged files visibly outweigh ordinary class peers in HIT slot sampling.
- New `_enforce_ronnestad_floor()` post-pass: every build1 / build2 / peak phase MUST include ≥1 Rønnestad-tagged file. Picks same-class Rønnestad to preserve per-class counts (vo2_short slot → vo2_short Rønnestad). Falls back to any HIT slot if no same-class candidate exists.
- **Result (24w plan):** 0 → 4 Rønnestad picks across build1 (vo2_short 40/20), build2 (vo2_short 30/15), peak (vo2_short 40/20), taper (recovery 30/30). All 3 canonical Rønnestad protocols (30/15, 40/20, 30/30) now appear at least once.

### Tests
- 741 / 3 / 1 — same baseline as v4.6.2 (3 pre-existing wellness/training-load flakes unchanged). Per-class floors held: vo2_short 10/10, sweet_spot in build1+build2 ≥1 (canonical 4-shape rotation preserved).

## v4.6.2 — Planner diversity push: every workout in a 24w plan is now a different file (2026-05-03)

### MAJOR — 100% slot uniqueness in 24-week plan
- 24w plan: **150 distinct files / 150 sessions = 100% slot uniqueness** (was 109/150 = 73% at v4.6.1, 117/150 = 78% at v4.6.0). Every workout in the plan is a unique ZWO file.
- Per-class distinct ratios: endurance 26→52 (54%→100%), recovery 0→15 (the score floor was excluding ALL 111 recovery files), tempo 21/21 (100%), every other class 100%.

### Root cause + fix — class-aware score floor
- `score_workout` rewards TSS + Z3+ structure, which fairly rates HIT classes but systematically under-scores **endurance** (intentionally low TSS, no structure) and **recovery** (very low TSS). Pre-v4.6.2 the strict score≥5 floor cut endurance pool **496→48 files (10%)** and recovery pool **111→0 files (0%)**, forcing the planner to cycle through the same handful of files.
- `_build_pool_indexes` now applies a class-aware floor:
    - HIT classes (vo2max/vo2_short/threshold/over_under/anaerobic/neuromuscular/sweet_spot): score ≥ 5
    - tempo / mixed: score ≥ 4
    - endurance / recovery: score ≥ 1 (essentially none)

### Planner knobs tightened
- `_DIVERSITY_BUDGET_DIVISOR` 8 → **24**: cap = ceil(class_session_count/24). Endurance with 48 sessions: cap drops 6→2 picks per file. Most classes now cap at 1 per file with graceful fallback.
- `_NOVELTY_BOOST` `{0:1.5, 1:1.0, 2:0.5}` → `{0: 5.0, 1: 0.05, 2: 0.001}`. First pick gets 5×, second pick crashes 100×, third+ effectively zero. Sampler exhausts the never-picked pool before any repeat.

### Hard floor extension
- `_enforce_build2_peak_hard_floor` now adds `sweet_spot: 1` to the build1 floor, so the canonical `{threshold, vo2max, sweet_spot, over_under}` 4-shape rotation appears in every build phase regardless of seed.

### Tests
- Updated `test_only_score_5_plus_workouts_picked` and `test_only_score_5_plus_files_picked` to mirror the class-aware floor (HIT≥5, tempo/mixed≥4, endurance/recovery≥1).
- 738 → 741 passed. 3 v4.6.1 known-carryover planner-diversity gates (`test_24_week_plan_uses_at_least_150_distinct_files`, `test_24w_plan_uses_high_distinct_file_ratio`, `test_per_class_distinct_high_diversity_ratio`) **all pass** at v4.6.2. Same 3 wellness/training-load flakes from v4.6.0 carried over.

## v4.6.1 — Mixed-class reclassification + Rønnestad detection + planner variety bonus + today marker (2026-05-03)

### MAJOR — Reclassify 1069 mixed → specific class
- 852 of 1069 `mixed`-class files re-examined and promoted to specific class via secondary_flags + zone-time signals. Mixed pool 1069 → 217 (162 truly signal-less, 55 with weak flags). Distribution shift: `endurance` 44 → 496, `threshold` 223 → 368, `vo2max` 336 → 365, `over_under` 211 → 301, `tempo` 265 → 330, `neuromuscular` 289 → 302, `anaerobic` 289 → 296, `recovery` 83 → 111, `vo2_short` 107 → 116, `sweet_spot` 103 → 117. Closes "planner can't reach interesting interval workouts" bug.
- **Rønnestad detection** — 17 files identified as Rønnestad-style microintervals per Rønnestad et al. 2015 (*Scand J Med Sci Sports* 25:143-151) — cycle_period 30-90s + ≥10 reps + work power 95-115% FTP. Tagged `is_ronnestad: true` and renamed explicitly (e.g. "Neuromuscular Rønnestad-style 2x12x30/30s (60min)").

### MAJOR — Planner variety bonus + Rønnestad in build/peak
- **`variety_score(zwo_features)`** — sampling-weight multiplier 0.5–3.0 from segment count + zone entropy + Rønnestad/microinterval/over-under/sprint bonuses. Sqrt-shouldered into per-file weight on HIT slots. Rønnestad bonus 1.5×.
- **`WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE` rebalanced** to sprinkle `vo2_short` / `anaerobic` / `neuromuscular` into every phase (was absent in base, scarce in build).
- **Hard floor** for build1/build2/peak: ≥1 anaerobic + ≥1 neuromuscular + ≥3 vo2_short via post-sampling swap.
- **Result (24w plan):** vo2_short picks 4 → 11, neuromuscular 2 → 4, anaerobic 4 → 5, avg hard_segment_count 7.11 (was ~3-5 boring steady), distinct files 99 → 106.

### Today marker
- `.cal-day.cal-today` — 2px solid red border + red glow (was faint blue tint, no border).
- `calJumpToToday()` targets `[data-date=today]` cell directly with `scrollIntoView({block: 'center'})` (was off-target via week-row offsetTop math).

### Tests
- 718 → 738 passed (+20 across `tests/test_reclassify_mixed.py` + `tests/test_planner_variety_bonus.py`). Same 3 wellness/training-load flakes from v4.6.0 carried over.
- **Known carryover (3 planner-diversity gates):** `test_24_week_plan_uses_at_least_150_distinct_files`, `test_24w_plan_uses_high_distinct_file_ratio`, `test_per_class_distinct_high_diversity_ratio` (sweet_spot 13/23 = 57%, target 20 distinct or ≥65%). Caused by the cache reshuffle: `endurance` pool grew 11× from RECLASSIFY-MIXED but `sweet_spot` only +14, and the planner's per-class novelty tuning hasn't caught up. v4.6.2 will address with multi-plan rotation + per-class novelty re-tune.

## v4.6.0 — Library sanity overhaul + planner full-utilization + plan config UI + homepage clarity (2026-05-03)

### MAJOR — Library structural overhaul
- 2966 of 3054 ZWO files (97%) renamed + descriptions regenerated to match actual segment structure (was 77.8% mismatch). 995 files reclassified to correct content_class. Examples: `recovery_spin_15min` containing 8 sprints @ 165% FTP → renamed Neuromuscular. `threshold_4x10min` at 113% FTP → renamed VO2max. `sweet_spot_2x20min` actually 3x15min → renamed accordingly.
- 864 files fixed where descriptions showed "0min @ X% FTP" (Duration<60s segments now display in seconds, e.g. "30s @ 110% FTP", or fold into adjacent blocks).
- All ZWO files now have `<author>Domestique Library</author>`.
- Audit log at `workouts/.overhaul_manifest.json`.
- workouts/.content_classification.json regenerated from rewritten files.

### MAJOR — Planner full library utilization
- 24-week plan now uses 117+ distinct files (was 117 of 3054 = 3.8%). Diversity ratio ≥75%. Per-class minimums: tempo/sweet_spot/threshold/vo2max ≥15 each (target), over_under/vo2_short ≥8, anaerobic ≥6, neuromuscular ≥4, recovery ≥4, endurance ≥12. Note: 35% of library currently classifies as `mixed` — until those 1069 files are reclassified, the absolute distinct ceiling is ~117/150 (78%).
- Diversity cap: no single ZWO picked more than ⌈class_session_count / 8⌉ times.
- Novelty boost: 1.5× weight for files never picked, 0.5× for picked twice.
- used_names rolling window 6w → 12w (more files surface across plan).
- Duration tolerance ±25 min (was ±5).
- Candidate pool now content_class only (no filename-prefix pre-filter that excluded valid candidates).

### Plan Configuration UI
- PLAN WEEKS dropdown greyed out + auto-computed from event date when goal=event_preparation. User's manual value cached and restored on goal-switch.
- New GET /api/plan/preview endpoint returns phase split using same `derive_phases()` as /api/plan/generate. Plan Overview right panel now shows all 5 phases for 20-week plan (was missing BUILD2 + PEAK).

### Homepage clarity
- Today's recommendation hero block shows BOTH original planned + adjusted (when modified) with explicit "Adjusted to {type} due to {reason}" chip.
- New "View plan ↗" link jumps to plan grid for context.
- Defensive `fixZeroMin()` regex sweep at 5 description render sites (extra safety even after library overhaul).
- /api/today-session response includes `adjustment_reason` field.

### Tests
- 687 → 718 passed (+31 across library consistency, planner utilization, plan config endpoint, homepage today consistency). 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load test-isolation flakes carried over.

## v4.5.5 — Activity-detail zones + intervals + polarization classification (2026-05-03)

### NEW
- **Power zones (Z1-Z7+SS) bar chart** in activity detail modal — replaces "No zone data" placeholder when ICU has the breakdown. Color-coded per Coggan zones (green Z1/Z2, yellow Z3, orange Z4, red Z5, purple Z6, dark Z7, amber SS).
- **HR zones (Z1-Z7) bar chart** — separate panel below power zones, ICU's HR zone labels (Recovery / Aerobic / Tempo / SubThreshold / SuperThreshold / Aerobic Capacity / Anaerobic).
- **Polarization classification banner** — Treff 2019 PI value (`PI = log10(Z1/Z2) × log10(Z3/Z2)`) + classification label (polarized / pyramidal / threshold / hiit / base / unique) using centroid-distance method (closest canonical pattern wins). Color-coded chip with confidence score and 3-bar Z1+Z2 / Z3+Z4 / Z5+ distribution. Info icon shows research citations.
- **Intervals table** — replaces "No interval data" placeholder when ICU has structured intervals. Columns: # / Name / Duration / Avg Power / FTP% / Avg HR / Zone. Sortable, sticky header.
- **/api/ride/<id>/detail** now lazily fetches ICU's `/api/v1/activity/<id>` when cached record lacks zones/intervals; persists back to local cache. Fields surfaced: `time_in_zone`, `hr_time_in_zone`, `intervals`, `polarization`.
- **NEW analytics.py** — Treff Polarization Index helper + centroid-distance classification per FastFitness.Tips heuristic. Citations: Treff et al. 2019 (Frontiers in Physiology, doi:10.3389/fphys.2019.00707) + FastFitness.Tips.

### Tests
- 666 → 687 passed (+21 across detail-zones + polarization-index + classification edge cases). 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load flakes carried over.

## v4.5.4 — Cloudflare UA fix + interval variety + non-diagonal renders (2026-05-03)

### FIXED — root cause of multi-version ICU sync saga
- **ICU sync was silently 403'd by Cloudflare** for the default Python-urllib User-Agent. Affected all `urllib.request.urlopen` calls to intervals.icu since at least v4.4.0. Symptom: "Connect Intervals.icu in Settings" toast even after pasting valid creds. Now sends `User-Agent: Domestique/4.5.4 (https://github.com/platypus45/domestique)` on every request → all calls succeed.

### NEW — planner interval variety
- **WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE rebalanced** — endurance/tempo dominance dropped, sweet_spot/threshold/vo2max/vo2_short/over_under/anaerobic/sprints raised. Base phase late weeks now include threshold + occasional vo2_short. Build phases more aggressively VO2 + over-under.
- **Per-week interval floor** — every non-stepback week MUST have at least 1 interval-shaped pick in mid/late base, ≥2 in build/peak. Post-sample swap if floor not met.
- **Mixed-with-flags treated as interval-shaped** — 363 mixed-class workouts that have secondary_flags=has_threshold_work / has_vo2_work / pattern_microinterval / pattern_over_under now reachable as valid interval slots.
- **Result: interval-shaped picks 28.7% → 56.7% (24-week plan)**, all 7 hard content_classes appear in build1+build2+peak.

### FIXED — visual diagonal bug
- **`buildPowerBlocks` cases tempo/recovery/default no longer render as diagonal trapezoids.** They were generating `pctLow !== pctHigh` which the SVG renderer interpreted as ramps. Now flat: tempo=82, recovery=50, default=68. Snake_case aliases added (sweet_spot, over_under, vo2_short, neuromuscular).
- **secondary_flags overlay** — long_z2/endurance with `has_threshold_work=true` or `pattern_microinterval=true` now shows the embedded interval spikes ON TOP of the steady base, so users see structural detail on mixed workouts.
- **Tooltip legend** — every cell tooltip ends with "STEADY (bar height = avg power)" / "INTERVAL on (spike = work)" / "RAMP" so users understand the rendering.

### Tests
- 654 → 666 passed (+12 across creds-profile + interval-variety + ui-shape).
- 3 pre-existing wellness/training-load test flakes (PRE-V4.5.4 baseline) — flagged for v4.5.5.

## v4.5.3 — Auto-detect athlete ID from API key (2026-04-30)

### NEW
- **`training.discover_athlete_id(api_key)` — auto-detects the authenticated athlete.** GETs `/api/v1/athlete/0` (ICU resolves `0` → the API key's owner) and returns the parsed `{id, name, ...}` dict. Used by `/api/setup/save` so the user only has to paste an API key — no more typo-induced HTTP 403 from a mistyped 7-char athlete ID.
- **Settings UI: athlete ID is now optional.** The athlete-ID input is hidden behind an "Advanced: enter athlete ID manually" toggle. After saving an API key, an inline badge shows `Auto-detected: i225278 — Haringo`. If a user opens "Advanced" and types an ID that disagrees with the API key's owner, the response carries a `warning` field and the dashboard alerts the user — but still honours the user-submitted override.
- **`/api/setup/save` response fields.** New optional fields: `athlete_id_detected` (set when the server filled in a missing ID), `athlete_name` (bonus from `/athlete/0`), `warning` (set on submitted-vs-discovered ID mismatch).

### Tests
- 646 → 654 passed (+8 auto-detect regression: helper 200/403/network/empty-key paths, only-api-key auto-fill, both-match no-warning, both-mismatch warning, discover-failure graceful fallback).

## v4.5.2 — Hot-reload ICU creds + 30-min throttle reset on save (2026-05-02)

### FIXED
- **Settings save now hot-reloads ICU credentials in-memory.** Previously, pasting new ICU creds in Settings wrote `~/.domestique/profiles/<id>/.env` correctly but the running uvicorn process kept using the creds loaded at startup, so sync continued to fail with `ICUAuthError` until the user restarted Domestique. Root cause: `training.fetch_recent_activities` / `fetch_recent_wellness` were leaving stale module-level `config.ICU_ATHLETE_ID` / `config.ICU_API_KEY` attributes after their explicit-override path, shadowing the dynamic `__getattr__` proxy that resolves from `ProfileManager._env`. Two fixes: (1) `del config.ICU_*` in those `finally` blocks instead of restoring the previous value, so `__getattr__` resumes; (2) `setup_save` defensively `delattr`s any stale shadow attribute after `pm.save_env`.
- **Sync throttle resets when creds change.** The `.last_sync_at` rides + wellness markers are zeroed out on every credential change, so the next `/api/rides/sync` runs immediately — previously the 1h throttle would still say "Already synced — try again in N min" even after the user just pasted fresh keys.
- **`db._auth_disabled` resets on creds change.** If the background sync had been disabled by 5 consecutive 401s on the OLD bad key, saving fresh creds clears the flag so the loop resumes without restart.

### NEW
- **`/api/setup/save` response carries `creds_test`.** Saves a quick `athlete/<id>` GET against the new creds and returns `creds_test: "passed" | "failed: <reason>"`. The dashboard alerts `Saved, but ICU rejected the new credentials: <reason>` when the probe fails — instant feedback instead of waiting for the next sync to silently fail.

### Tests
- 642 → 646 passed (+4 hot-reload regression: in-memory cache update, throttle reset, shadow-attribute unshadow, invalid-creds probe).

## v4.5.1 — Activity modal expand + ICU link + truthful sync + variety presentation (2026-05-02)

### NEW
- **Click any past activity → expands to ICU-style detail modal** in THIS WEEK, calendar overlay, and frontpage Recent Activities. Was silently doing nothing on Recent Activities; was early-returning on rest days even when an actual ride was attached.
- **"↗ Open on intervals.icu" link button** in activity-detail modal when ride.source==="icu". Builds URL from external_id (strips "icu_" prefix from ride_id when needed).
- **Variety presentation** — cell labels include structure suffix: "TEMPO 82m" → "TEMPO · 4×8 82m"; "ENDURANCE 180m" → "ENDURANCE · steady 180m"; "VO2MAX 90m" → "VO2MAX · 4×1 90m". Per-week unique-types badge in THIS WEEK header ("5 types · 7 unique files"). Per-cell tooltip showing name, content_class, filename, score. Surfaces the underlying file diversity that was hidden by repeated content_class labels.

### FIXED
- **B1 Sync now toast was always saying "0 new rides"** even when ICU silently 4xx'd. /api/rides/sync now returns `status` ∈ {ok, throttled, fetch_failed, no_credentials} + `last_sync_at` epoch float. UI shows truthful toast: "Sync failed: <reason>", "Already synced — try again in N min", "Synced: N rides + M wellness (synced HH:mm)".
- **B2 "REST DAY" label appeared on days with attached actual rides.** _classify_card_state now checks has_actual BEFORE session_type=="rest" so rest days with rides classify as "completed". UI defense-in-depth drops REST label when actual present.
- **Planner verification** — confirmed v4.5.0 sampler is producing 99 distinct ZWOs across 102 sessions (97% unique) in user's actual fresh plan. Top-5 share 7.8%. The "boring repetition" perception was content_class label sameness (now fixed via structure-suffix presentation).

### Tests
- 639 → 642 passed (+3 card_state regression).

## v4.5.0 — Diverse planner + ICU wellness sync + THIS WEEK actual rendering (2026-05-01)

### NEW
- **Planner diversification overhaul** — replaces fixed phase.session_types + handwritten HIT_VARIANTS + hardcoded durations with 3-layer sampling: (1) IntensityBudget per phase enforces weekly load, (2) WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE per phase+week_in_phase selects appropriate content_classes, (3) type rotation penalty cycles through threshold/vo2max/sweet_spot/over_under in any 6-week window. 24-week plan now uses 121 distinct ZWO files (was 51), top-5 file coverage 9.5% (was 25.5%), 98.8% cross-regen diff. All 4 hard types appear in build phases. 1069 previously-untouched "mixed" content_class workouts now reachable for z2 fallback.
- **ICU wellness sync** — fetches HRV/Sleep/RHR/weight from ICU into ~/.domestique/wellness/<date>.json. New GET /api/wellness?days=N. /api/readiness uses local wellness fallback when ICU live empty (was returning Insufficient_Data even when local rides existed).
- **POST /api/rides/sync?force=1** — bypasses 30-min throttle, runs full rides + wellness sync immediately. Powers the new "Sync now" button.
- **THIS WEEK actual rendering** — each day cell now has top half (planned) + bottom half (actual ride matched by date) with TSS-achievement tinting (green ≥90% / yellow 70-89% / red <70%). Tooltips on actual cells show source / avg power / zone-time / decoupling.
- **Intensity chart ACTUAL bar** — populates from /api/calendar weeks.actual_z1z2_min etc (was always "no actual exposure" even when rides existed). Delta annotations show how far over/under planned distribution.
- **Adherence counter** — properly counts actuals matching planned days (sessions where actual.tss > 0.3 × planned.tss = done). Color-coded chip (green ≥80%, yellow 50-79%, red <50%).
- **"Sync now" button** in THIS WEEK header next to Reconcile Week.

### Tests
- 622 → 639 passed (+17 across diversification + wellness sync + force-sync param).

## v4.4.2 — Frontpage data wiring + workout-display truthfulness (2026-05-01)

### FIXED
- **B1+B2+B3 Frontpage missing today's ride / counters at 0** — lazy ICU sync was only wired to `/api/calendar`. Now also fires from `/api/activities`, `/api/today-session`, `/api/recent-activities`. Force-resync if today's date is missing AND last_sync >30min ago.
- **Local CTL/ATL/TSB fallback** — `/api/readiness` and `/api/training-load` now compute training-load from local rides (51 ICU + 12 FIT) when Garmin/ICU sync is stale or empty. New `source: "local"|"icu"|"mixed"` field surfaces provenance. Frontpage no longer shows dashes when local rides exist.
- **Unified default response shape** — both `/api/today-session` and `/api/readiness` now return numeric `score` + `data_status` field instead of one returning hardcoded 50 and the other returning None.
- **B4 Sprint modal showed steady Z2 bar** — `buildPowerBlocks` was missing cases for sprint, sprints, overunder, anaerobic, vo2_short, ftp_test. All 12 documented session_types now have explicit waveform patterns. Modal also prefers `zone_dist` over session_type heuristic when populated.
- **B5 Misleading workout display names** — display names now derive from `content_class` (post-v4.1.2 content classifier) instead of misleading filename. Example: `sweetspot_6x2min_90min.zwo` with content_class=endurance now shows "Sunday — ENDURANCE — 90min" instead of "Sunday — LONG Z2". Filename-derived name moved to subtitle for provenance when it disagrees.

### Tests
- 614 → 622 passed (+8 across lazy-sync wiring + local-load fallback).

## v4.4.1 — Decimation cap + TestRematch + time-in-zone fallback (2026-04-27)

### FIXED
- Sample decimation in `/api/ride/<id>/detail?include=samples` now uses `ceil(n/1800)` stride, hard-capping output at ≤1800 points. Was 1960 due to floor-stride rounding.
- 3 stale TestRematch fixtures fixed — tests previously placed an activity 1 day in the future relative to fake today, causing `_collect_week_activities` to filter it out (correctly!). Now uses `patch("app.date", FakeDate)` with fake_today set 5 days after the activity. No implementation changes.
- Activity-detail modal time-in-zone bar now shows "⚠ No zone data for this ride" placeholder when all zones are zero (was silently suppressed). Same fallback for intervals table when empty.

### Tests
- 611 → 614 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped.

## v4.4.0 — Calendar ICU sync + on-track bar + activity detail modal (2026-04-27)

### NEW
- **On-track summary bar** at top of dashboard. 4-stat headline (compliance % chip, CTL trajectory ±5 band, polarized split actual vs target, phase countdown) + 4 stacked target-vs-actual rails (Z1+Z2 / Z3+Z4 / Z5+ minutes / TSS). Color-coded (blue/orange/red/purple) per rail with traffic-light compliance bands per CONCEPT-SCI (green 80-115%, amber 50-79% or 116-135%, red else). Bottom action line shows session count + next session + missed.
- **Activity detail modal** opens on click of past ride cell. Hero stats (Distance/Time/TSS/IF/NP/AvgPower) + secondary stats (HR avg/max, elevation, kJ, kcal, cadence, weight, FTP at ride) + power+HR SVG sparkline + time-in-zone Z1-Z7 stacked bar + scrollable intervals table + eFTP delta badge.
- **Intervals.icu activity sync** — 90-day rolling pull on app boot (or first /api/calendar after 1h). New endpoint POST /api/rides/sync. ICU activities normalized to /api/rides flat array alongside FIT-imported rides. Yesterday's ride visible in calendar within minutes of opening dashboard.
- **GET /api/ride/<id>/detail** with optional `?include=samples` (decimated to 1800 points for responsive modal).
- **PHASE_TARGETS + PHASE_POLARIZED_TARGETS** constants in training_planner.py per CONCEPT-SCI synthesis (Foster 1998, Seiler 2006, Stoggl & Sperlich 2014, Coggan & Allen 2019).

### FIXED
- **THIS WEEK starts Monday** (was Sunday in some date-rollover edge cases). All week boundaries Mon-anchored both server (Python `weekday()`) and UI (`mondayOf()` helper).
- THIS WEEK now uses /api/calendar dual-half rendering so actual rides surface alongside planned sessions.
- Per-week sidebar in monthly calendar now shows Z5+ pill alongside existing Z1+Z2 and Z3+Z4 pills.

### Tests
- 594 → 611 passed (+17 new across calendar ICU sync, ride detail endpoint, ISO Monday, on-track summary).
- 3 pre-existing test_plan_api.py::TestRematch failures (unrelated; flagged for v4.4.1 if needed).

### Known cosmetics (queued for v4.4.1)
- Time-in-zone bar suppressed when ride has all-zero zones (rendering correctly, but cosmetically empty).
- Empty intervals array suppresses table section (correct behavior; flagged for clarity).

## v4.3.1 — Calendar polish (2026-04-26)

### FIXED
- ISO-week straddle: `/api/calendar` now dedupes weeks by `(iso_year, iso_week)` preferring planned over history. Was emitting two `is_current=true` rows when ISO week boundary crossed stored plan boundary.
- Calendar cells now drag-droppable (intra-ISO-week only, matching `/api/plan/move-session` semantics). Visual feedback: green outline on valid targets, red on invalid (rest / cross-week / completed). On 422 source-not-found shows "Couldn't find that session. Try refreshing." toast.
- Toast container repositioned to top-right per spec (was bottom-right). Click-to-dismiss added; 3s auto-dismiss preserved.

### Tests
- 591 → 594 (+3 calendar dedupe cases in tests/test_calendar_no_duplicate_current.py)

## v4.3.0 — Calendar overlay + 7 bug fixes (2026-04-26)

### NEW
- **Calendar overlay (intervals.icu-style)** — vertical-scroll calendar showing planned + actual side-by-side per day. Past 12 weeks of history + entire current plan future. Phase color-coded planned cells; achievement-color (green/yellow/red) on actual cells based on TSS ratio. Auto-scroll to current week on load. "Jump to today" button.
- New endpoint `GET /api/calendar` — merged plan + rides payload per week, with weekly aggregates (planned/actual TSS, Z1-Z2 / Z3-Z4 / Z5+ time splits, completion_pct).
- New `card_state` field on every session: rest / planned / completed / missing_workout. Drives UI styling consistently.

### BUG FIXES
- **B1** Move-session "no stored week contains source data" — replaced cryptic 404 with structured 422 `{error: source_session_not_found, date}`; lazy-loads plan from disk on source-week miss. UI shows friendly toast.
- **B2** Click in THIS WEEK opens wrong workout — title now reads `content_class` (not stale `session_type`); click verifies match before opening; mismatch shows inline ⚠ banner.
- **B3** Re-generate plan picks same workouts — added `seed_salt = time.time_ns()` per regeneration + candidate-pool shuffle before ranked-pick. 93% of zwo picks now differ between consecutive regens.
- **B4** Yesterday's ride invisible — calendar merges plan-sessions with ride records by date (FIT + ICU sync identical); each completed day shows actual TSS + duration + Z-split.
- **B5** No plan-vs-actual side-by-side — THIS WEEK now uses calendar dual-half rendering.
- **B6** Some workouts unclickable — `card_state="missing_workout"` cards now visibly grayed with ⚠ icon + "click Re-draw" tooltip (instead of silently disabled).
- **B7** Tempo workouts had unwanted ramping — audited 285 tempo files, found 23 with undesired `<Ramp>` in main body, rewrote to single `<SteadyState>` at 82% FTP. New `tests/test_tempo_workout_shape.py` guards future regressions.

### Tests
- 570 → 591 passed (+21 new across calendar, regen-shuffle, lazy-load-move, tempo-shape).

### Known soft (non-blocking, queued for v4.3.1)
- When the ISO week straddles a plan-stored-week boundary, two weeks may both carry `is_current=true` in the calendar payload. Data internally consistent; UI auto-scrolls to first match. Cosmetic only.

## v4.2.0 — Library filters + weekly grid polish (2026-04-26)

### LIBRARY (Sprint A)
- Score sync: single shared `training_planner.score_workout()`; `/api/workouts` and planner now return identical scores (closes v4.1.1 Bug C PARTIAL). Distribution 24/50/26 vs 30/50/20 target.
- New filter query params on /api/workouts: content_class, tags (OR-multi), duration_min/max, has_flag, search, sort
- New endpoint GET /api/workouts/tags returning distinct tags across library
- Library UI: content-class dropdown (12 enum values), tag chip-list, duration range slider, sort dropdown, search box (300ms debounce), empty-state with Clear-filters button, hover preview with zone breakdown
- MINSCORE tooltip aligned: "Good 7+, Medium 4-6, Low <4"

### WEEKLY GRID (Sprint B)
- Score badge per non-rest session card (gold/medium/low tier color)
- Re-draw button (⟳) per non-rest non-completed card → calls /api/plan/re-draw, swaps in new pick from same type, dedupes against week
- Today marker (today-session class) + current-week highlight + auto-scroll-into-view on first load
- Drag-drop drop-target visual feedback: valid (highlight) vs invalid (dim) — ISO-week + REST + completed gating
- Phase row banding: 5 distinct color tints (Base/Build1/Build2/Peak/Taper)
- Stepback week visual: opacity 0.85 + clearer RECOVERY label
- Week TSS column reformatted: Planned + Actual labels, green if met, red if missed
- Plan progress header above grid: "Phase: X — Week N of M — K weeks to Peak"
- Action toasts (3s auto-dismiss): re-draw / move / dismiss success messages
- Plan export: CSV + JSON download via dropdown

### Known cosmetics (non-blocking)
- Toast position bottom-right (spec said top-right, kept consistent with existing helper)
- No auto-rewrite of pre-v4.1.2 stored plans on content-class drift; user can regenerate plan to align (POST /api/plan/regenerate)

### Tests
- 525 → 570 passed (+45 new tests across score-sync, library-filters, redraw-endpoint)

## v4.1.0 — Planner grill pass (2026-04-24)

### FEEDBACK LOOPS CLOSED
- DFA α1 post-ride: mean < 0.5 over last 3 rides → tomorrow's threshold/VO2 auto-swapped to Z2 + banner shown (revert button)
- Aerobic decoupling > 5% → next-day Z2-recommended advisory banner
- Foster Monotony > 2.0 over 14 days → next week's planned TSS reduced 15%
- CTL: local 42-day EWMA fallback when Intervals.icu unavailable (was hard-coded 37.0)
- eFTP drift > 3% for 7+ days → auto-applied with revert toast (48h window)
- FIT → Intervals.icu one-way upload after import

### PLANNER FIXES
- Weekly-plan unified: cross-week dedupe via used_names rollup (was resetting every request)
- /api/plan/reforecast now calls tp.reforecast() + persists downshifts for negative TSB (was TSS-annotation only)
- /api/plan/re-draw — new endpoint, actually re-rolls a day's workout with dedupe (vs. prior completion-classifier)
- Score formula: tss×0.6 + variety_bonus + vo2_bonus (was 5 + tss/50)
- ISO-week merge aligned Mon-Sun (was Sat-Fri mismatch → 5/7 days wrong)
- available_days now persisted in plan JSON (Mondays no longer ghost-excluded)

### FTP TEST FLOW END-TO-END
- FIT import detects FTP tests by power-profile shape (Coggan 20min + Ramp) — sets is_ftp_test, ftp_test_type, ftp_test_suggestion, ftp_test_halted
- Ramp auto-halt: cadence<50 + power<85% target for 3s → halt step recorded
- Post-import modal: Update/Keep/Custom buttons; formula auto-fills suggested FTP
- /api/profile/ftp-history endpoint + Settings sparkline chart + FTP source badge
- 4 new FTP-test protocols added to the library (tagged ftp_test)
- ZWO <tags> now indexed; /api/workouts?tags=ftp_test filter works
- FTP Tests category tab in Library with yellow-border distinct styling

### eFTP PROVENANCE
- athlete.json gets ftp_source field: tested_coggan_20min | tested_ramp | eftp_auto | manual
- Manual FTP edit requires confirmation dialog
- Every FTP change logged in ftp_test_history ledger (including accepted eFTPs)
- Local fitness_estimation.estimate_ftp() now wired to FIT import post-hoc

### ENDPOINT CONTRACT ALIGNMENT (Wave 4)
- /api/settings exposes ftp_source + ftp_source_date
- /api/readiness flattens dfa_cap_applied + decoupling_advisory to top-level booleans
- /api/rides returns flat array (legacy {json, fit} envelope preserved at /api/rides/legacy-envelope)
- /api/readiness/revert-cap endpoint
- eFTP auto stamps source="eftp_auto" (was "eftp_icu")
- ftp-history rows carry canonical+alias field names

### Library
- 3050 → 3054 workouts (4 WoZ FTP tests added)

## v4.0.0-alpha — Trainer subsystem removed; library grows (2026-04-24)

### BREAKING
- Trainer hardware support removed entirely. Domestique is now a planner + workout library + post-ride viewer. Ride on Tacx app / MyWhoosh / Golden Cheetah / Zwift, import FIT after.
- No more live ride view. No BLE, FTMS, ERG, SIM, FE-C, gate logic, WebSocket.
- Profile schema v3 → v4: `paired_devices`, `trainer_effect`, `bike_weight_kg` removed (auto-stripped by migration)
- Dependencies: `bleak`, `pycycling` removed.
- Deleted files: trainer_connection.py, power_control.py, templates/training.html, + 5 trainer test files.
- Removed endpoints: /api/training/start, /stop, /pause, /resume, /trainer-health, /debug-snapshot, /difficulty, /ws/training, /api/training/pair-*

### ADDED
- POST /api/ride/import — FIT file upload + parse + store in ~/.domestique/rides/
- GET /api/workout/download/{filename} — ZWO file download for loading into external trainer app. Disambiguated from /api/workout/{category}/{filename} (metadata) to kill a route shadow that previously resolved the download path to category=`download`.
- GET /api/course/<region>/<file>/download — CRS course file download
- Existing plural-name endpoints retained: /api/rides, /api/profiles, /api/workouts, /api/weekly-plan (not renamed to singular despite earlier aspirational naming in MASTER §6).
- Ride history list on dashboard with click-to-open post-ride report
- Import FIT button on dashboard header
- 1253 new workouts in library: original procedurally-generated structures (pyramids, short VO2/threshold/sweet-spot, over-unders with varied ratios, neuromuscular sprints, and broad category coverage) + 24 GitHub MIT/Unlicense imports (macgrrl, michaelahlers). Total library: 1797 → 3050. All new files authored `<author>Domestique Library</author>`.
- docs/cycling_apps.md — comparison of free cycling apps accepting ZWO/FIT
- docs/workout_sources.md — library source docs + legal stance

### Rationale
Trainer code was ~16k LOC maintaining BLE protocol parity across 36 fixes. User pivoted to pure planner role: rides elsewhere, brings FIT back.

## [3.6.0-fix35] — 2026-04-20

### Workout library UX
- MIN SCORE filter now defaults to ALL + `?` info tooltip explains it (`Score = 5 + TSS/50`).
- Block hover tooltips on workout detail SVG: per-block `<title>` with `{TYPE}: {duration} at {pct}% FTP`.
- Sub-minute intervals render as "30 sec" (was "0 min").
- Description: line break between `|`-separated blocks so each "STEADY: ..." is on its own line.
- Title validator: strips "Recovery" prefix when `IF > 0.75`; prefixes "Easy" to VO2/Threshold when `IF < 0.55`.

### Weekly plan — move session now visible after refresh
`/api/weekly-plan` merge switched from strict date-equality to ISO week match. Drag-and-drop sessions no longer snap back after page refresh.

### Upcoming panel + elevation bar — no more flicker
`updateElevation` and `renderUpcomingWorkoutSegments` cached last non-empty HTML. Only explicit clear on session stop. Previous behavior wiped DOM on every empty-data tick → flicker between segments.

### Cadence "10" render bug (was actually 85-90)
`smoothValue('m-cad', targetCad, 300)` with a 300 ms ease was being reset every rAF frame → animation never advanced past initial value, crept through "1...3...7...10..." instead of landing on the real reading. Changed to 0 ms (instant) matching the fix28-hero-bounce and fix31-live-hr patterns. Same fix applied to `m-speed`.

### ERG target no longer scaled by trainer_effect
`trainer_effect` (0.5 default) was halving ERG power targets (`0.25 × FTP × 0.5 = 31W` instead of `62W`). Wrong — `trainer_effect` is for SIM grade only; ERG power is absolute. Three dispatch sites patched. HR-cap scaling retained. SIM-grade paths remain correctly scaled.

### FTP test protocols — two new ZWO workouts
- `workouts/ftp_test_coggan_20min.zwo` — 68-min Allen-Coggan: warmup 14min + primers + 5min easy + 5min blowout (105% FTP) + 10min recovery + 20min main test + 10min cooldown. FTP = 0.95 × 20-min average.
- `workouts/ftp_test_ramp.zwo` — ~35-min ramp: 5min warmup + 25×1min steps 56% → 200% FTP at +6%/min + 5min cooldown. FTP = 0.75 × best 1-min average in last completed step.
- Ramp auto-halt detector: cadence<50 rpm for ≥3 s AND 3-s avg power < 85% target → `EVENT=ftp_test_failed` + session stops.
- Post-test modal in ride-detail shows suggested FTP with "Update Profile / Keep Current / Custom" buttons.
- `ftp_test_history` persisted to `athlete.json`.
- New endpoint `POST /api/profile/update-ftp`.

### 42 new 30-min + 45-min workouts
Generator `generate_ftp_workouts.py` produces 3 variants × 7 categories × 2 durations = 42 ZWO files: recovery, endurance, sweet_spot, threshold, vo2, over_under, sprints. Deterministic via seed; auto-discovered by library endpoint.

### Tests
1017 pass, 1 skipped, 11 deselected, 3 pre-existing `test_plan_api.py` rematch failures (unrelated, predate fix35).

## [3.6.0-fix32-hr-hold-and-line-chart] — 2026-04-20

### [A] HR dropping to 0 between ticks — lite-tick HR hold-last-known
User report: "the heart rate stuff back to 0 in between ticks". Heavy-tick logs showed `hr=150bpm` consistently, so the backend's 1 Hz path was fine. The 4 Hz lite path was the culprit — BLE HR straps emit at 1 Hz while trainer frames arrive at 4 Hz, so 3 of every 4 lite ticks either:
- forwarded `d.hr=None` from a trainer frame whose merge failed the freshness gate (HR-2 staleness), or
- hit the `awaiting_data` branch (`_real_trainer_data` consumed by the heavy tick + no new BLE frame in the 250 ms window) which emitted `hr: null`.

Frontend's `(typeof d.hr === 'number' && d.hr >= 30) ? d.hr : NaN` gate then punched a gap into `SmoothGraph.push()` on each of those ticks. The rider saw a sawtoothing HR trace "dropping to 0 between ticks".

Fix: `app.py::_last_known_hr_if_fresh()` — reads the manager-stamped `_trainer_last_hr_{ts,bpm}` + `_hr_strap_last_{ts,bpm}` trackers and returns the newer of the two if its age is ≤ 10 s. The lite-tick branch and the `awaiting_data` branch both substitute this value when the current frame carries `hr=None` / `hr=0`. Real strap dropouts still surface as `---` once the hold window lapses.

### [B] Post-ride POWER chart: line instead of bars
User report: "I don't want bar charts but a line chart in post-ride summary". `templates/dashboard.html` L2841-2853 previously rendered POWER as zone-coloured `<polygon>` bars plus a matching `<line>` segment per step. Replaced with a single smoothed yellow polyline (`#eab308`, 3-point rolling mean, gap-preserving) over a faint zone-colour band (`opacity=0.12`) so the zone-distribution hint survives without overwhelming the line. HR overlay logic untouched.

### Tests
`test_ble_power_buffer.py`: 8 new —
- `_last_known_hr_if_fresh()` helper: never-set, fresh-trainer, fresh-strap, prefer-more-recent, window-expiry.
- `test_lite_tick_holds_last_hr_across_gap` — end-to-end simulation of the trainer-frame + substitution path.
- Dashboard static guard: POWER section must contain `<polyline ... stroke="#eab308"` and must not re-introduce the old zone-coloured polygon bars.

Full suite: 984 pass, 1 skipped, 11 deselected, 3 pre-existing `test_plan_api.py` rematch failures (unrelated to fix32 — predate these changes on `clean-main`).


## [3.6.0-fix31] — 2026-04-20

### Evidence-based fixes from today's ride logs (via fix30 logging infra)

**Mock/sim data deleted entirely.** Ride logs showed `MockDataSource` seed values (`power=169W cadence=89rpm hr=120bpm`) bleeding into the real broadcast on ~75% of 4 Hz ticks because `app.py`'s WS else-branch invoked `session.mock_tick()` whenever `_real_trainer_data` was None. Corrupted NP/TSS/decoupling AND the first-pedal gate fired on phantom data (`[gate] FIRED path=rising p=169w c=89rpm streak=1.0s at elapsed=0.0s`). Fix: removed `MockDataSource` class, `mock_tick()` / `mock_tick_lite()` methods, the else-branch fallback, the "Continue without connecting" button, and `simulate_ride.py`. Empty ticks now broadcast `{awaiting_data: true, power: null, cadence: null, hr: null, speed: null}`. No synthetic data can ever reach the session again.

**ERG auto-pause never resumed.** `ride_285f0abc.log` showed `ERG IDLE -> ACTIVE: 31W` at t=0, `ERG -> PAUSED (reason=auto_power_drop)` at t=30 s, then 130 s of silence. User reported "ERG never got hold of me cycling". Root: `ERGController.update()` had no handler for `state == PAUSED`, and the external resume call gated on a strict triple-gate. Fix: added `_check_auto_resume()` in ERGController with relaxed hysteresis (5-sample rolling: `mean_power > 10W AND mean_cadence > 5rpm`) + internal `on_resume()` triggers REACTIVATING and busts `_last_sent_watts` so the cached target re-dispatches.

**Ride-report HR chart 300+ bpm spikes.** Ride-report SVG polyline included every saved sample including `hr=0` dropouts, mapping far below `hMin=50` → polyline dove vertically creating "spike" artifacts. Log analysis confirmed no HR > 135 bpm was ever broadcast by the backend. Fix: ride-report chart now (a) gap-skips invalid HR samples with segmented polylines, (b) 3-point rolling mean for HR, (c) axis clamped to physical [40, 220] range so pre-fix26 archives can't distort scale. Power bars preserve 0W (coasting is meaningful).

**Live HR graph sawtooth + hero BPM tile stuck.** Live HR graph had no smoothing; hero tile was 400 ms ease-lerped. Fix: `smooth-display.js` HR draw now has 3-point NaN-preserving rolling mean (parity with post-ride SVG); gap-skip preserved. `hr-big` hero tile: 400 ms ease-lerp → 0 ms instant (parity with fix28-hero-bounce for power). Direct `textContent` write on every 4 Hz lite tick + HR zone band pointer repositions per-tick per LTHR zones.

### Autopause timer kept running (regression of fix26 URG-R1-2)
`training_live.py:3160` guarded `_active_seconds` on `not self._paused` only — auto-pause sets `_workout_auto_paused` but NOT `_paused`. Same leak on distance accumulator. Fix: both guards now include `_workout_auto_paused`. Also fixed: `_power_return_streak` hysteresis was resetting on tick 2, preventing auto-resume from ever firing. New events `EVENT=autopause_eval / session_pause / session_resume` added on the decision path.

### Logging infrastructure extended
- `EVENT=tick_awaiting_data` when BLE has no fresh data (replaces silent mock fallback)
- `EVENT=autopause_eval` per-tick during RECORDING
- `EVENT=session_pause reason=auto_power_drop` + `EVENT=session_resume reason=auto_power_drop paused_for_s=N` on edge transitions

### Tests
- Full suite: 977 pass, 1 skipped, 11 deselected, 3 pre-existing `test_plan_api.py` rematch failures.
- 15+ new: sim-flow deletion, ERG auto-resume, autopause timer freeze/resume, ride-chart smoothing.

<!-- Superseded detail on autopause timer kept below as deep-dive reference -->

## [3.6.0-fix31-autopause-timer-rca] — 2026-04-20

### Root cause — pause screen never lifted + tile timer kept counting
Two linked bugs surfaced on post-fix26 rides, both in the power-based
auto-pause path at `training_live.py` around L3178–L3234.

**Bug 1 — `_active_seconds` leaked during auto-pause (regression of fix26 URG-R1-2).** The guard at L3112 only checked `not self._paused and not self._stopped`. `pause()` is called only on explicit drops (user / sensor / ble); the newer power-based auto-pause path sets `_workout_auto_paused = True` without touching `_paused`. So the tile timer kept incrementing through an auto-pause window and the broadcast `t` field kept counting. Same leak on the distance accumulator at L3255: gravity-assist virtual-speed on a downhill with `power=0` kept adding km while the rider was stopped.

Fix — extend both guards to also check `_workout_auto_paused`:
```python
if not self._paused and not self._stopped and not self._workout_auto_paused:
    self._active_seconds += 1
...
if not self._workout_auto_paused:
    self._distance_km += display_speed * dt / 3600
```

**Bug 2 — auto-resume could never fire.** `_power_return_streak` only advanced on the *first* non-zero tick after a zero streak — because on the second non-zero tick `_zero_power_streak` had already been cleared to 0 and the `else: _power_return_streak = 0` branch reset the counter. Net effect: the `>= 2` auto-resume check in the auto-pause block could never actually fire, so the session stayed auto-paused forever the moment the rider resumed pedaling. Hysteresis fix — accumulate return streak whenever `_zero_power_streak > 0 OR _workout_auto_paused`, so the counter grows across multiple recovery ticks until the auto-pause flag clears.

### Instrumentation (fills `/tmp/log_analysis.md` gap)
The auto-pause decision path previously emitted nothing. Added three
structured events on `domestique.session`:
- `EVENT=autopause_eval zero_power_streak=N threshold=M return_streak=N power=W cadence=R auto_paused=bool phase=X` — every tick, DEBUG level
- `EVENT=session_pause reason=auto_power_drop phase=X elapsed=N zero_power_streak=N` — on edge transition into auto-pause, INFO level
- `EVENT=session_resume reason=auto_power_drop from_phase=X to_phase=Y elapsed=N paused_for_s=N` — on edge transition out, INFO level (wall-time `paused_for_s` snapped against `_autopause_start_mono`)

### Tests — 6 new regression guards
`TestFix31AutopauseTimerRCA` in `test_training_live.py`:
- `test_auto_pause_freezes_active_seconds` — primes session to ROUTE, fires auto-pause on 5s of power=0, asserts `_active_seconds` flat across 10 more ticks
- `test_auto_pause_freezes_distance` — same for `_distance_km`
- `test_auto_pause_auto_resumes_on_power_return` — power=200W for 2 ticks clears the flag
- `test_autopause_event_emitted` — EVENT=autopause_eval per tick
- `test_autopause_session_pause_event_emitted` — exactly one session_pause on edge
- `test_autopause_session_resume_event_emitted` — exactly one session_resume on clear with paused_for_s present

### Scope
- `training_live.py`: 4 edits (active_seconds guard, distance guard, return-streak hysteresis, autopause event block)
- `test_training_live.py`: +6 tests
- `CHANGELOG.md`: this entry

## [3.6.0-fix30] — 2026-04-20

### Root cause of "waiting for first pedal stroke" forever
`MetricsEngine.update()` received `power`/`cadence` from the WS loop without coercion. If BLE dropped a field, the value arrived as `None` or `NaN`:
- `None >= 5` → `TypeError` swallowed by the WS loop's `except Exception`, so the heavy-tick silently no-op'd
- `NaN >= 5` → False silently, gate evaluated False every tick

Unit tests used clean int inputs and never surfaced the bug. Fix: coerce `power`/`cadence` to `int(0)` on None/NaN/negative at entry, BEFORE any comparison.

### Industry-pattern gate robustness (layered on the fix29 3-path OR gate)
- **Trailing-mean smoothing** (1.5 s window) — low-sustained + no-cadence paths now gate on the trailing mean, not the raw instantaneous sample. Rising-edge still uses raw (the transition is the point).
- **Hysteresis** — once a pass is seen (streak > 0), arm threshold drops to 0.3× for the next tick. Prevents boundary flutter from resetting streak.
- **Distance-accumulated fallback** — fires `first_pedal_detected()` after ~0.05 km of virtual distance (5-10 crank revs) with power>0 AND cadence>0, even when the power-threshold path is ambiguous.
- **Phantom-spike rejection** — downgrades a sample > 2× trailing mean (when trailing mean < arm threshold) to the trailing mean for gate evaluation. Raw sample still flows to broadcast (separates "running" from "recording").

### Logging infrastructure — extensive, backend-only
- **Per-session log file** at `~/.domestique/logs/ride_<iso_timestamp>_<session_id>.log`. All log output for the session's lifetime teed to this file. 20-file rotation, 1 Hz flush.
- **Named loggers** by category: `domestique.ble`, `domestique.gate`, `domestique.phase`, `domestique.power`, `domestique.trainer`, `domestique.hr`, `domestique.session`, `domestique.ws`.
- **71 structured `EVENT=...` emissions** across 6 files — BLE frames + connect/disconnect, gate decisions (per tick), phase transitions, ERG set/pause/resume/spike, gradient dispatch, FTMS timeout/reset, RTL stats (60 s), user config, road feel, Monod CP/W' fit, aerobic decoupling, DFA α1, ride save.
- **Env toggles**: `DOMESTIQUE_VERBOSE=1` (all DEBUG), `DOMESTIQUE_LOG_CATEGORIES=gate,ble` (selective). `DOMESTIQUE_RIDE_LOG_KEEP=N` (default 20).
- **Runtime toggle**: `GET/POST /api/training/log-level` body `{"level": "DEBUG", "category": "gate"}`.
- **`GET /api/training/debug-snapshot`** — dumps every internal state worth inspecting. Payload includes: session metadata, phase, first-pedal gate state, last BLE trainer frame + age, power buffer, BLE lifecycle states, RTL stats, ERG state, GradientController state, course position, live metrics (decoupling / W'bal / DFA α1), session config (FTP / LTHR / rider+bike weight / trainer_effect), last 10 phase transitions, last 30 s of power/HR/RR tails.
- **`DEBUGGING.md`** — grep recipes for common failure modes, endpoint usage, category names.

### Tests
- Full suite: 971 passed, 1 skipped, 11 deselected, 3 pre-existing unrelated failures (`test_plan_api.py` rematch classifier, carried from fix26).
- New tests: 10+ across first-pedal paths (None/NaN coercion, rising-edge vs lite-tick corruption), gate-robustness (phantom-spike reject, hysteresis, distance fallback, trailing-mean smoothing), debug-snapshot shape, log rotation, log-level endpoint.

## [3.6.0-fix29] — 2026-04-20

### Bike-ride testing surfaced 3 user-visible bugs — all fixed

**ARMED overlay race** — For 300-500 ms between `/api/training/start` and the first WS broadcast, the ride screen showed blank `---` tiles with no "WAITING FOR FIRST PEDAL STROKE" overlay. Fixed: `startSession()` now sets the overlay visible synchronously, before `connectWebSocket()`. `applyPhaseGate()` continues to toggle it normally once WS ticks arrive.

**First-pedal gate was too strict — slow spin-up never triggered recording**. Previous gate required `power ≥ 30 W AND cadence ≥ 40 rpm AND sustained 3 s` which failed for riders who start with a slow cadence ramp-up. Rewritten as 3-path OR:
- **Rising edge** — `(prev_power=0, prev_cadence=0) → (power>0, cadence>0)` sustained 1 s. Fires on the first real pedal stroke.
- **Low-threshold sustained** — `power ≥ 10 W AND cadence ≥ 5 rpm` sustained 2 s. Handles slow spin-ups.
- **No-cadence fallback** — `power ≥ 25 W` sustained 3 s. Handles trainers without cadence sensor.
- 6 new regression tests. Phantom-watts rejection preserved (single-frame noise still doesn't fire).

**Lap routes showed empty surface bar for laps 2+** — Routes with `lap_route: {laps: N, base_km: X}` (e.g. "Cobbled Classic Sectors × 2", "Hidden Cruise 47 × 2") stored surface_segments for ONE lap only in `surface_types.json`, but `distance_km` reflected the full multi-lap distance. Backend's `_route_surface_segments` passed segments through verbatim — laps 2+ fell through to asphalt baseline. Fixed: when `lap_route.laps > 1`, base segments are now tiled N times with cumulative offsets. Cascading bugs fixed as byproduct: aggregate legend text + visual bar both correct now. `surface_mix_pct` discrepancy in `routes.json` for 1 route (`Cobbled Classic` stores `{gravel:100}`) is a stale-data authoring issue, flagged separately.

### Tests
- Full suite: 931 passed, 4 pre-existing failures (3 `test_plan_api` rematch + 1 `test_diag_recent_ticks` due to gate semantics change — updated expectations inline), 1 skipped.
- 15 first-pedal tests + 4 lap-tiling tests all green.
- 6 diagnostic agents ran before Wave 2 — reports at `/tmp/armed_diag_*.md` + `/tmp/spatial_diag_*.md`.

## [3.6.0-fix28] — 2026-04-20

### Physics audit — 16 parallel agents, CRITICAL bugs found + fixed

**C-1. CdA/Cw semantic mismatch (trainer resistance ~37% too light)**
`FTMSTrainer.DEFAULT_CW` was documented as "Martin 1998 CdA m²" but the FTMS 0x11 wire byte encodes `ρ × CdA` (kg/m). Bumped `0.32 → 0.51` for reference parity. Bonus: `compute_virtual_speed` was multiplying by `ρ × 0.51` (double-ρ) — fixed formula to `0.5 × Cw × v²`.

**C-2. Hero WATTS tile 250ms ease-lerp clobbered 4-Hz broadcast**
fix27d delivered watts at 4 Hz but the UI's `renderInterpolatedFrame` overwrote Path A instant writes with a 250 ms eased ramp every rAF frame. User saw smooth transitions, not pedal-stroke bounce. Fixed: `smoothValue('hero-power', latestPow, 0)` — 0 ms ease.

### HIGH-priority fixes

- **Power chart Y-axis FTP-anchored** (was "160 W hits top when max-seen is 170 W"). Now: `yMax = max(1.2 × FTP, rolling_30s_peak × 1.05)`. Overlay 6 zone-colored horizontal bands at FTP × [0, 0.60, 0.75, 0.89, 1.04, 1.18]. HR axis: `[max(40, rest_hr-10), max_hr]`.
- **SmoothGraph moving average 5pt → 2pt** — 1.25 s box filter at 4 Hz was killing pedal-stroke ripple; now 0.5 s preserves it.
- **Decoupling scatter session-aware redesign**:
  - FreeRide/Route/Climb → scatter only at ride end (matches industry post-ride-only convention).
  - Strict-duration workouts → planned-midpoint classification (no retroactive recolor).
  - Colors: blue `#3b82f6` + yellow `#fbbf24` (colorblind ΔE 45, replaces purple/red which were too similar).
- **HYBRID FreeRide SIM routed through GradientController** — fix27e's 5s lookahead + 2%/s rate-limit now also applies to HYBRID mode (was raw grade dispatch). Plus HYBRID descent ×0.5 flatten for COURSE parity.

### MEDIUM-priority fixes

- **Post-ride DFA α1 sparkline** in ride-detail view — completes fix25 persistence by wiring the reader half. VT1/VT2 reference lines.
- **Bike weight configurable in Settings** (was hardcoded 9.0 kg). Persists to athlete.json; flows to FE-C page 0x37. Range clamp [5, 50] kg.

### LOW-priority polish batch

- **L-1**: BLE power=None now holds last known value (was coerced to 0, poisoning NP/TSS/decoupling rolling windows)
- **L-2**: ARMED idle 15-min timeout — prevents walk-away sessions from sitting ARMED forever
- **L-3**: CRS parser fraction-vs-percent autodetect (max|g|≤1.0 → ×100)
- **L-4**: Tacx cadence 0xFF sentinel explicit gate (was relying on upstream)
- **L-6**: ZWO unknown-tag warn-once per file (was silently ignored)
- **L-7**: GPX first-point missing `<ele>` warn (was silently anchoring to 0)
- **L-8**: DFA log-log R²≥0.95 gate (new `dfa_status="low_r2"`)
- **L-9**: Tacx Crr None intent documented (pycycling validator blocks 0xFF sentinel on BLE path; ANT+ path honors it)

### De-branded scrub

Removed 584 vendor-brand references from code, docs, templates, comments. Design intent + numeric values preserved; product-specific citations replaced with neutral language ("reference parity", "community-documented"). 4 references retained in TRADEMARKS.md / COURSES_LICENSE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md for legal posture.

### Tests
- Full suite: 928 pass, 1 skipped, 11 deselected, 3 pre-existing unrelated failures (test_plan_api rematch classifier from fix26).
- 16 parallel physics-audit agents produced 16 reports at `/tmp/phys_audit_NN.md` (kept for reference).

## [3.6.0-fix27] — 2026-04-20

### CRITICAL — power under-reporting (user-reported 320 W felt → 170 W shown)
**Root cause**: the 4-Hz BLE power stream was latest-wins sampled into `_real_trainer_data`, but `session.update()` only runs on heavy ticks at 1 Hz — so **3 of every 4 BLE frames were dropped**. On bursty pedal-stroke peaks (320 W surge lasting ~1.2 s) we'd often catch a trough sample (~170 W) instead of the peak.

**Fix**: `app.py::_on_real_trainer_data` now buffers all incoming BLE frames for the current 1-second window. Heavy tick pops the buffered list, emits `mean` (what metrics use) and `peak` (what the tile shows). No more frame loss.

Also: `PowerSmoothing` spike clamp loosened 2.0× → 2.5× so real pedal-stroke peaks (common at >2× 5-s average during hard efforts) aren't artificially capped. UI reads `d.power` everywhere; removed stale `d.display_power` alias.

### CRITICAL — trainer difficulty stuck at pre-fix26 value for existing users
**Root cause**: fix26 shipped `trainer_effect=0.5` as the new default for reference parity (grade × 0.5 before dispatch). But existing users' `device_prefs.json` still held their pre-fix26 value (1.0 or manually-tuned 0.8). UI hard-coded `1.0` on page load, never fetched the persisted value, and POST didn't save. User's 2% felt like 6-7% because the stored 0.8 was actually being used.

**Fix**:
- One-shot migration on app start: if `trainer_effect ≥ 0.8` and `trainer_effect_fix27_migrated` sentinel is not set, reset to 0.5 and stamp the sentinel. Idempotent; won't re-run. Users who explicitly set a low value (< 0.8) are untouched.
- `GET /api/training/difficulty` — returns persisted value + percent + migration status.
- `POST /api/training/difficulty` — now calls `pm.save_trainer_effect(value)` so the new value survives session end and app restart.
- Training page fetches persisted value on load; initializes slider + label. `STATE.difficulty` default 0.5 (was hard-coded 1.0).
- One-time migration toast: "Trainer difficulty reset to 50% for reference parity. Adjust in the slider if you prefer."
- Settings tab gets a dedicated **Trainer Difficulty card** with slider, `?` tooltip, and auto-save indicator.

### Added — rider-weight FE-C fallback
If the profile has no rider weight set, the Tacx previously silently used its internal 75 kg default — invisible to the user. Now: log a WARNING and explicitly dispatch ANT+ spec default (75 kg) so the trainer acknowledges the page and the log trail reflects what's actually on the wire.

### Added — trainer-health diagnostics
`/api/training/trainer-health` response now includes:
- `trainer_effect` (current value, 0-1.5)
- `trainer_effect_source` (`device_prefs` or `default`)
- `trainer_effect_migrated` (boolean sentinel)

Plus an optional `DEBUG_POWER_TRACE=1` env var — when set, logs every incoming BLE power frame alongside broadcast `d.power` so future under-report reports can be diff'd raw-vs-display.

### Added — 4-Hz power broadcast (reference HUD parity, fix27d)
Frontend graph + hero-power tile previously updated at 1 Hz (session heavy tick), hiding the per-pedal-stroke amplitude. Now:
- Lite tick (4 Hz) emits the **latest BLE power sample** via `session.update_lite` — hero tile and SmoothGraph point land every 250 ms.
- Heavy tick (1 Hz) continues to emit `power` = 1-s mean (for NP/TSS/decoupling — these metrics need 1-s resolution or they thrash at 4 Hz). Adds `power_1s_mean` for explicit downstream access.
- SmoothGraph `historySize` 600 → **1200** points so a 5-min window fits 4-Hz samples without the oldest points falling off prematurely.
- Result: hero tile now visibly bounces per pedal stroke — the 320 W the user felt is now the 320 W they see.

### Added — reference design-pattern parity (fix27e)
- **FTMS request-reply state machine** with correlated `_track_ftms_request`: resend after 0.5 s of silence, re-request-control after 1.0 s — matches the reference's request-reply handshake instead of fire-and-forget.
- **RTL (Rider-to-Load) 60-s interval stats**: online Welford variance logger emits `FTMS RTL Stats` line every 60 s in the reference's log format (min/max/mean/stddev over the window). Lets the user diff a ride against a reference log apples-to-apples.
- **SIM-grade audit log**: `[FTMS] SIM Grade raw=X.XX% --> scaled=Y.YY%` — one line per grade dispatch showing `user_grade` and `user_grade × trainer_effect`. Makes it visible in the log whether fix27a's 0.5 migration actually landed.
- **Tri-state BLE device lifecycle** (`_DeviceLifecycle`): connected / recovering / lost — replaces the fix26 "weak-signal" toast-on-every-tick. Chip colors on the device header reflect the tri-state via `d.ble_states`.

### Research provenance (for anyone auditing the physics path)
- Grade dispatch: audited across `training_live.py::_determine_trainer_command` → `trainer_connection.py::FTMSTrainer.set_simulation_params` / `TacxBLETrainer.set_slope`. Single scaling point at the dispatcher; no double-multiplication. reference's formula confirmed: `grade_to_trainer = user_grade * TRAINER_EFFECT` (default 0.5).
- Power pipeline: direct injection test with 320 W held steady → broadcast emits 320 W through all phases (ARMED, INDEXING, RECORDING, PAUSED). No scale factor, no hidden smoothing, no virtual-power leak. The real bug was the 4→1 Hz frame-drop (fixed above).
- reference binary extracted surface taxonomy + BLE trace: FTMS Indoor Bike Sim frames, CRR=0.004 baked into reference, CdA=0.051 wire-scale (0.51 real), wind=0 constant. No climb-dampening, no power re-estimation, no FTP bias.
- Golden Cheetah compared: GC dispatches grade 1:1 (no trainer-difficulty slider at all), power is raw instantaneous watts from trainer BLE, display smoothing is optional 1-30 s user slider.

### Tests
- Full suite: **906 passed**, 1 skipped, 11 deselected (Python 3.12).
- +12 new regression tests across `test_profiles.py`, `test_training_live.py`, `test_ble_power_buffer.py`, `test_power_control.py`, `test_trainer_connection.py`.
- 3 pre-existing `test_plan_api` rematch-classifier failures flagged as fix26 IMPL-ADAPT regression (unrelated to fix27 — will address separately).

### Ship constraint
- DMG rebuilt to `~/Desktop/Domestique.dmg`. `/Applications/Domestique.app` NOT touched (user still testing on the bike).
- Sandbox-blocked SSH → user must `git push origin clean-main` from their own terminal.

## [3.6.0-fix26] — 2026-04-19

### CRITICAL bike-test bugs fixed
- **Ghost ride**: walking away from "START PEDALING" no longer accumulates phantom ride data. First-pedal gate now requires triple-condition: `power ≥ 30 W` AND `cadence ≥ 40 rpm` AND sustained 3 s. Fallback 60 W for 5 s when no cadence sensor.
- **Pause timer kept running**: elapsed timer now uses `session.active_seconds` accumulator (only advances when not paused + not stopped + in RECORDING/INDEXING phase). Distance / km counters freeze too.
- **Phantom watts while paused**: data-collection (DFA buffer, decoupling buffer, Pw:Hr scatter) halts during pause.
- **Top WATTS tile stuck at averaged value**: now reads instantaneous `d.power` from broadcast, not `d.avg_power`. Subtle "INSTANT" sublabel.
- **HR graph oscillating 0↔beat**: NaN-sentinel break; chart now skips null samples instead of plotting at 0.
- **HR tile showed "2 bpm"**: unphysical-HR gate at `< 30 or > 220` bpm → UI renders `--`.
- **EXIT button failed during pause**: unified exit handler works from any state (paused/armed/recording). ESC key and header EXIT both route through `exitWorkout()`.
- **Duplicate device entries in status header**: device list is now keyed by BLE address (stable), reconciled in place on reconnect instead of appended.
- **DFA panel "not every strap sends RR" misleading**: now two-state: "stabilizing" when RR count > 0; "check HR strap contact" when zero RR for 30 s.

### Trainer physics — reference parity
- **Crr table** aligned to reference's road-wheel column (community sources extracted):
  - asphalt 0.004, cobble 0.0065, gravel 0.012, dirt 0.016, sand 0.004, unknown 0.004
- **Tacx Road Feel** proprietary command (`set_neo_modes`) dispatched per surface:
  - asphalt → SIMULATION_OFF, cobble → COBBLESTONES_HARD, gravel → GRAVEL, dirt → OFF_ROAD, sand → SIMULATION_OFF
- **Road Feel intensity** calibrated to match reference's felt amplitude through pycycling's 0-100 scale (community consensus; pycycling maintainer warns ≥50 feels aggressive and 100 may damage the trainer):
  - asphalt 0, cobble 45, gravel 30, dirt 22, sand 0, unknown 0
  - (Initial values 80/70/60/40 were 2-3× too aggressive per user's reference A/B testing; realigned after deep-dive into local reference binary extracted surface taxonomy + community-calibrated intensities.)
- **Trainer difficulty slider** honors reference 50% convention (halves felt grade before dispatch).
- **CdA default** lowered 0.51 → 0.32 (hoods position per Martin et al. 1998).
- **Weak-signal toast** debounced: 5 s sidebar badge → 10 s warning toast → 30 s "offline" message with 3-check debounce. Was flickering on every Tacx frame gap.

### Deletions — ~13,500 LOC removed
- **Strava** residue (~600 LOC): `surge_config.py`, `keychain.py`, `relay/`, strava methods, setup.html strava sub-block (Garmin Connect preserved).
- **Running module** (~350 LOC): `running_zones.py`, RUNNING_* constants, `Goal.sport`/`PlannedSession.sport` dataclass fields, running-branch logic. (DB `activities.sport` column kept — ICU metadata.)
- **Nutrition subsystem** (~12,500 LOC): `nutrition_planner.py`, `nutrition_db.py`, `food.py`, `targets.py`, `test_nutrition.py`, `sports_nutrition_db.json`, `off_sports_nutrition.json`, `main.py` + `workout_picker.py` (CLI artifacts), 7 API endpoints, fuel-plan UI in training.html, Products tab in dashboard.html.

### Added — W'bal live-feed enhancements
- 10-min W'bal sparkline in the W'bal panel.
- CP tick on live power graph.
- "Sustain: M:SS" predictive label — when P > CP for ≥ 5 s, server computes `sustain_s = wbal_j / (power - cp_w)`. Renders `M:SS` when finite, `∞` otherwise.
- Intervals.icu `w_prime` now wired into profile with source priority (manual > icu > monod > fallback).
- Monod-Scherrer 2-parameter CP/W' fit from best-efforts (R² ≥ 0.90, ≥ 3 points).
- Gap handling: 2 s BLE power gaps no longer falsely trigger recovery integration.

### Added — Intervals.icu reliability
- Typed exceptions: `ICUAuthError`, `ICURateLimitError`, `ICUServerError`, `ICUNetworkError`.
- 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff + jitter. Honors `Retry-After` on 429.
- 401s now bubble to `_is_auth_error`; 5-strike auth-disable actually works (was dead code before fix26).
- Dashboard banner when `auth_disabled` or `consecutive_failures > 2`. Dismissable.
- `w_prime` manual-source guard at both SQL and profile-priority layers.

### Added — Daily plan adaptation redesign
- `daily_adapt_plan` demoted to projection-only (no more in-place mutation of `current_plan.json`).
- `POST /api/plan/move-session` — drag-to-reschedule; sets `user_moved=True` flag honored by regen/reforecast.
- `POST /api/plan/rematch?apply=0|1` — reconciles completed Intervals.icu activities to prescribed workouts. Preview vs apply.
- Classifier requires **all three** within tolerance: TSS ±15% AND duration ±20% AND IF-band match. 2/3 → `ambiguous`. 1/3 → `no_match`.
- Status enum: `pending / done / missed / moved_from:<date> / dismissed / ambiguous / done_partial`.
- `POST /api/plan/dismiss-session` — sets/clears dismissal. Dismissed stays visible (grayed) with "Un-dismiss" action.
- Plan regen preserves `user_moved`, `completion_matches`, `dismissed_at`, past-week statuses.

### Added — Sleep/screensaver inhibit while riding
- Cross-OS: macOS `caffeinate -i -w <pid>`, Windows `SetThreadExecutionState`, Linux `systemd-inhibit --what=idle`.
- Fires on `/api/training/start`; releases on `/api/training/stop` + launcher SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- Idempotent; keeps holding during pause (user may be catching breath).

### Added — Device memory + forget
- Paired devices persisted to profile's `_athlete["paired_devices"]` (keyed by BLE address).
- `GET /api/ble/paired` + `POST /api/ble/forget?address=...`.
- "×" forget button next to connected device chips in scan UI.
- Dedup by address on add (re-pairing same device replaces entry, doesn't append).

### Added — Colorblind-safe surface palette
- Gravel #a0522d → #c8804d (lighter rust; deut ΔE vs dirt 9.1 → 35.1).
- Dirt #8b6f47 → #5a4a32 (dark char-brown).
- Asphalt #374151 → #4b5563 (more visible on card backgrounds).
- Unknown #4b5563 → #6b7280 (no longer collides with new asphalt).

### Added — HR data feed hardening (carry-over from fix25 context)
- RR intervals now timestamped `list[tuple[monotonic_s, rr_ms]]`.
- Reconnect flushes `_pending_rr` + flags resync; DFA window cleared.
- RR filter tightened 150-3000 ms → 300-2000 ms.
- BPM spike filter (>40 bpm/s rejection).
- `TACXTrainer._cached_hr` gets `_cached_hr_mono` staleness gate.

### Tests
- Full suite: **857 passed**, 1 skipped, 11 deselected (Python 3.12). Up from 775 pre-fix26.
- New tests across trainer_connection, training_live, training_planner, plan_api, profiles, sleep_inhibit, training (ICU).

### Ship constraint
- DMG rebuilt to `~/Desktop/Domestique.dmg` only. **Installed app at `/Applications/Domestique.app` was NOT touched** — user was testing on the bike during the wave; they install the new DMG themselves after the ride.

## [3.6.0-fix25] — 2026-04-19

### HR band data feed hardening (CRITICAL upstream of DFA + decoupling)
Every HR-derived metric now survives a noisy BLE feed. Previously an RR-interval gap, a 40 bpm spike, or a mid-ride reconnect could silently poison DFA α1 and aerobic decoupling for the next 3–5 minutes.

- RR intervals now carry a monotonic timestamp (`list[tuple[float, int]]`) so downstream consumers can detect gaps.
- BLE disconnect flushes both `_pending_rr` and `MetricsEngine._rr_buffer`; the first packet after reconnect is flagged `rr_is_resync=True` and the rolling DFA window is cleared + re-warms for 180 s.
- RR range filter tightened 150-3000 → 300-2000 ms (matches Task Force HRV spec).
- BPM spike filter: rejects packets with |ΔBPM| > 40 bpm within 1 second; resumes after 2 agreeing packets.
- Ectopic-triplet detection (short-long-short at ±20% of median) with neighbor-mean replace, and the corrected-beat count propagates to MetricsEngine so DFA's 5% artifact gate includes scrubbed beats.
- Session-level HR staleness gate: `TacxBLETrainer._cached_hr_mono` stamps every HR update; both direct-BLE and Tacx-relayed HR are read-gated at 5 s, with direct BLE winning unconditionally in the 0-10 s window.
- `hr_contact_ok` flag (from HR spec flag bits 1-2) propagates to the UI banner "Heart-rate sensor not making contact" after 3 s of contact loss.
- Off-by-one fix in the RR-parse loop; reserved flag bits 5-7 guarded; `_external_hr` writes now atomic under a lock.
- Zero → thirteen regression tests on the HR data pipeline.

### DFA α1 live feed (CRITICAL corrections to zone classification)
Zone labels were **inverted** from prevailing cycling convention (Gronwald 2020 / Altini). Athletes reading α1 = 0.80 as "AEROBIC Z2" were actually in Z3 tempo.

- Zones corrected per spec: **α1 ≥ 1.00** = aerobic (green, Z1–Z2, below VT1); **0.75 ≤ α1 < 1.00** = tempo (yellow, Z3, VT1 to VT2); **α1 < 0.75** = threshold or above (red, Z4+). Bar tick-marks at 1.00 (VT1) and 0.75 (VT2); the old 0.50 tick is gone.
- **Time-gated 120 s rolling window** (was 200-beat window, which dropped to 67 s at 180 bpm — below spec).
- **Warmup suppression**: no α1 emitted until ≥ 180 s elapsed AND ≥ 90 beats in window AND session phase RECORDING. UI shows "stabilizing…" pill.
- Unphysical clamp [0.30, 1.60]; outside → `dfa_status="unphysical"`, no numeric shown.
- Artifact threshold unified at 5% (was asymmetric 3% UI warn vs 5% compute bail).
- **10-minute sparkline chart** in the DFA panel — HiDPI canvas, dashed VT1/VT2 reference lines, gap breaks on data discontinuity.
- `dfa_history` persisted to ride JSON (was memory-only).
- Synthetic-signal regression test: pure-Python impl matches `nolds.dfa(order=1, overlap=False)` to 4 decimal places on pink-noise input.

### Aerobic decoupling (CRITICAL bugs in compute + scatter)
Fixed four compute bugs and the scatter-plot axis inversion vs Intervals.icu convention.

- **Client recompute deleted**: `templates/dashboard.html` no longer recomputes `(ef1-ef2)/ef1` from mean power using a different filter than the server. Everyone renders `s.decoupling_pct` (canonical NP-per-half per Friel / Intervals.icu / WKO).
- **Efficiency factor** is now the ride-aggregate `NP / avg_HR` (was per-tick instantaneous P/HR — caused UI flicker).
- **Unified Z1 filter** across live + post-hoc + client: `50 ≤ power_w ≤ 2500 AND 60 ≤ hr_bpm ≤ 220` (was four different conventions — HR≥40, HR≥100, HR≥60 etc).
- **Warmup trim 900 s** excluded from both halves (was included; rising HR during warmup inflated "decoupling" in the first 15 min).
- **Live value is provisional** during ride with `?` tooltip "Live estimate — final locked at ride end"; locked at ride stop. If ride < 40 min of filtered samples → label reads "ride too short".
- **Scatter axes flipped** to x=Power (W), y=Heart Rate (bpm) — Intervals.icu parity. First-half dots **purple** `#a855f7`, second-half **red** `#ef4444`, with **least-squares regression line per half**. Centroid markers + drift arrow preserved.
- **Heat pill** 🌡️ gate changed from `mode === 'erg'` (wrong — ERG can be outdoor) to `is_indoor` (broadcast from `trainer_connected` truth + session.indoor flag).
- FIFO cap 24 000 entries on decoupling buffers prevents unbounded memory on 6+ hour rides.

### Tests
- +19 regression tests across `test_trainer_connection.py`, `test_training_live.py`, `test_fitness_estimation.py`.
- Full suite: **750 passed, 1 skipped, 11 deselected** (Python 3.12).

### Scientific references
Implementation validated against:
- Peng et al. 1995 (original DFA), Gronwald et al. 2020 (cycling application), Rogero 2022 (real-time parameters), Schaffarczyk 2022 (reproducibility).
- Friel's "aerobic decoupling" formulation, Coggan NP per half, Intervals.icu decoupling spec.
- Open-source reference: `nolds.dfa`, Golden Cheetah `AerobicDecoupling.cpp`.

## [3.6.0-fix24] — 2026-04-19

### Added — FE-C page 0x37 rider configuration at Tacx connect
Previously deferred as S-4 in fix23 ("pycycling API doesn't expose this; needs upstream PR"). Turned out pycycling 0.4.1 (already in our venv) exposes `TacxTrainerControl.set_user_configuration(user_weight, bicycle_weight, bicycle_wheel_diameter, gear_ratio)` which writes FE-C data page 55 (0x37) to the Tacx BLE UART. No upstream PR needed.

`TacxBLETrainer` now pushes rider weight + bike weight (9.0 kg default) + wheel diameter (0.70 m for 700c) + gear ratio (1.0) to the trainer at connect, improving virtual-flywheel accuracy on the Tacx Neo 2T.

### Policy — skip-don't-lie
If the active profile has no rider weight set (raw `_athlete` dict missing `weight_kg`), we pass `None` and skip the FE-C write, letting the trainer use its internal 75 kg default. ProfileManager's property-level fallback of 70 kg is explicitly sidestepped so we never send fabricated data.

Valid rider range: [30, 200] kg. Outside → skip.

### Auto-reconnect replay
Cached user configuration is re-applied automatically on BLE reconnect via `TacxBLETrainer.connect()`'s auto-replay path.

### Trainer-requested re-send
When the Tacx sets `user_configuration_required` on FE-C page 0x19 (e.g. after a firmware reset), we detect the False→True edge in the FE-C data callback and re-send the cached configuration. Rate-limited to one send per 30 seconds.

### Defensive clamping
Inputs are clamped to pycycling's validation ranges (user ≤655.34 kg, bike ≤50 kg, wheel ≤2.54 m, gear 0.03–7.65) with floor 0 on bike and wheel so no ValueError can bubble up from pycycling.

### Tests
- +21 regression tests across 3 new test classes in `test_trainer_connection.py` (default values, skip-on-invalid, clamping, failure non-fatal, missing-key skip, no-double-send, trainer-requested re-send, reconnect replay).
- Full suite: 715 passed, 1 skipped, 11 deselected (Python 3.12).

## [3.6.0-fix23] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed — ERG mode no longer "re-initializes" on pause/resume (CRITICAL UX)
Prior behavior: user hits pause on an ERG ride, resumes, and waits up to ~55 seconds before the target power reaches the trainer again. Root cause was four compounding "safety" behaviors firing on every short user pause:
1. `training_live.py::_determine_trainer_command` sent SIM grade 0% every tick during pause — actively erasing the held ERG target.
2. `FTMSTrainer.pause_training()` always wrote FTMS Pause opcode `0x08` to the trainer. reference and Golden Cheetah both avoid this.
3. `FTMSTrainer.resume_training()` always replayed the full handshake (RequestControl `0x00` + Start/Resume `0x07`) regardless of whether control was still held.
4. `ERGController.on_resume()` unconditionally entered REACTIVATING: cadence ≥60 rpm for 2 s + 3 s dwell + ramp from 25% of target at 5 W / 2 s. For a 200 W target, full recovery took ~55 s.

### New reason-aware pause/resume contract
- `on_pause(reason=...)` / `on_resume(reason=...)` on `ERGController`, `FTMSTrainer`, `TacxBLETrainer`. Locked reason enum: `"user" | "sensor_drop" | "ble_drop" | "auto_power_drop" | "free_ride"`. Unknown → treated as `"user"`.
- `reason="user"`: pause is a wire no-op (no `0x08`); resume replays cached target instantly via `[0x05]`, skipping handshake if `_control_held=True`.
- `reason="sensor_drop" | "ble_drop" | "auto_power_drop"`: retains 2-s cadence gate for slam protection. The 25% soft-ramp is DELETED entirely per Golden Cheetah / reference consensus — ERG already scales with cadence.
- `reason="free_ride"`: controller disengages cleanly; on segment transition back to targeted step, `engage(target)` with debounce bust.

### Added — Connection-state tracking
- `FTMSTrainer._control_held` flag set on handshake, cleared on BLE disconnect or `0xFF CONTROL_PERMISSION_LOST` indication.
- `set_power()` checks `_control_held` before writing — re-handshakes on control-lost, queues the target while disconnected so reconnect auto-restore can replay.
- `_last_target_watts` cache on both FTMSTrainer and TacxBLETrainer for reconnect auto-restore and queue-while-disconnected.
- `on_reconnect_complete()` replays RequestControl + Start + cached target after BLE reconnect. Dedup: skip the handshake if control is already held.

### Added — ERG MODE ENGAGING → ERG MODE ON overlay
Full-screen overlay on user-resume: shows "ERG MODE ENGAGING…" with a spinner while the resume POST is in-flight, transitions to "ERG MODE ON" with a green check for 1.5 s, then auto-dismisses. Provides immediate visual confirmation that ERG has re-locked after a pause.

### Added — Trainer-offline signal
When `resume_training()` exhausts its 3×2 s reconnect budget, the endpoint now returns HTTP 503 and emits a WebSocket `trainer_status: offline` event. The training template consumes this and shows a toast: "Trainer offline. Tap to reconnect."

### Added — Neo 2T quirks alignment
- 50 W midpoint-ramp on large target deltas in both FTMSTrainer and TacxBLETrainer (Tacx Neo 2T vendor recommendation — softens transitions on any FTMS trainer).
- (Deferred TODO) FE-C page 0x37 rider-weight configuration at Tacx connect — requires pycycling API extension, out of this wave's scope.

### Fixed — FreeRide → ERG transition never reached the wire
`engage() + set_target()` double-call on segment transition had `engage()` preloading `_last_sent_watts = target`, which caused `_determine_trainer_command` to debounce the target out. `engage()` now does state-transition + debounce bust only; first tick after engage writes the real frame.

### Fixed — Auto-power-drop recovery deadlock
`ERGController.update()` was skipped while `erg_auto_disabled=True`, but the flag is only cleared inside `update()` via the REACTIVATING→ACTIVE transition — stuck forever. `update()` now ticks unconditionally; the flag gates dispatcher output, not controller progress.

### Fixed — FreeRide side-effect cleanup
Workout stop now calls `erg_ctrl.disengage(reason="workout_end")` regardless of the final segment type.

### Fixed — `first_pedal_detected` target pipeline
The initial post-ARMED target now routes through `HRCapController` + trainer-effect bias like every other tick, not raw.

### Tests
- +28 regression tests across `test_power_control.py`, `test_trainer_connection.py`, `test_training_live.py`, new `test_resume_reconnect_signal.py`.
- Full suite: 694 passed, 1 skipped, 11 deselected (Python 3.12).

### Reference material
ERG behavior validated against Golden Cheetah (`src/Train/BT40Controller.cpp`, `ANTChannel.cpp`) and community reverse-engineering of reference (pycycling, gymnasticon, zwack). Key consensus adopted: no FTMS 0x08 on user-pause, no RequestControl replay when control held, no target watchdog, trainer holds target across pause.

## [3.6.0-fix22] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed — "WAITING FOR FIRST PEDAL STROKE" regression (CRITICAL)
- Removed adversarial auto-pause in `startSession()` — after `/api/training/start`, the session no longer POSTs `/api/training/pause`. The ARMED state machine (fix14) already gates recording, so the legacy auto-pause was both redundant AND wedging the session (paused+ARMED → never detected pedals).
- Also removed the auto-pause twin in the WS-reconnect handler (training.html:3211-3218).
- Belt-and-braces: `first_pedal_detected()` now clears `self._paused = False` as its first statement; ARMED/INDEXING streak counters run even while paused, so any future auto-pause re-introduction still unwedges on first pedal.
- 30-min paused auto-end safety net now runs regardless of phase.
- `/api/training/trainer-health` exposes `paused` for diag.

### Fixed — Pre-ride HR/power/cadence preview shows live data
- `TrainerConnectionManager.get_status()` now includes live `trainer.power`, `trainer.cadence`, `hr.heart_rate` — surfaced via a new `_last_trainer_frame` cache stamped on every `_dispatch_trainer_data` call.
- 5-second stale gate using `time.monotonic()` (robust to wall-clock steps); older than 5 s → `None` (frontend shows `--`).
- `pollDeviceStatus()` frontend now renders `--` when stale instead of misleading zeros.

### Added — Mini-map spatial surface bar (replaces % aggregate)
- Route mini-map now shows a horizontal colored bar where the position of each surface type matches its position along the route — not a percentage breakdown.
- Colors: asphalt `#374151`, gravel `#a0522d`, cobble `#9ca3af`, dirt `#8b6f47`, sand `#d4b896`, unknown `#4b5563`.
- Asphalt baseline painted first, so km not covered in `surface_types.json` render as asphalt (not void).
- `/api/training/info` now carries `surface_segments` canonical shape (was a latent gap).
- Canonical enum locked: `{asphalt, gravel, cobble, dirt, sand, unknown}` lowercase singular.

### Fixed — In-ride surface band now actually visible
- Previous band: 5 px at 0.6 alpha — invisible. Now: 14 px at 0.90 alpha with asphalt baseline + 1 px hairline top border.
- Palette aligned with mini-map for cross-screen parity.
- `#climb-panel` min-height bumped 60 → 96 px so the band doesn't crush the elevation curve.

### Fixed — UPPERCASE surface tokens leak through WS
- `CourseEngine.current_surface()` now normalizes Tacx road-feel tokens (`ASPHALT`, `COBBLESTONES_HARD`, `OFF_ROAD`, …) to the canonical lowercase enum at the data boundary. WS consumers no longer need to canonicalize.

### Tests
- +14 regression tests across `test_training_live.py`, `test_trainer_connection.py`, `test_route_picker_api.py`.
- Full suite: 641 passed, 1 skipped, 11 deselected (hardware-gated).

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-18

Full pre-release audit pass — security, correctness, performance, UX. 6 parallel fix waves covering 100+ bugs across backend, live-ride UI, dashboard UI, route engine, trainer/FIT, security/packaging, and second-pass deep scans (planner, workout variety, nutrition, concurrency, aerobic drift, edge cases).

### Breaking changes

User-visible behavior deltas vs v3.5.1 — read before upgrading:

- **`POST /api/training/save-ride`** now returns **422** on unknown fields (previously silently accepted `post_to_strava`, `screenshot_b64`). Body shape is exactly `{name, private}`.
- **`POST /api/nutrition/products`** now returns **422** on out-of-range macros (previously silently clamped). Per-macro cap 100 g, kcal ≤ 900, caffeine ≤ 400 mg/serving, sodium/fluid ≤ 2000, all values ≥ 0.
- **`GET /api/version`** no longer includes `platform` / `build` fields — response is exactly `{"version": "..."}`.
- **Rest-week adherence** now grades **100 → 0% across 0–50 TSS** (previously collapsed to 0% on any load). Normal-week adherence capped at **150%** (previously unbounded).
- **Workout picker seed** now includes `profile_id` — same athlete on the same date still sees stable picks, but **different athletes on the same date no longer see identical picks**. Existing plans are NOT re-rolled; new plans only.
- **HR-zone bucket cutoffs** in ride reports now derive from `zones.hr_zones()` (was hardcoded integers). Old rides may re-bucket by ±1 bpm at zone boundaries on re-render.
- **Paused rides auto-end after 30 min** of pause dwell. Users who pause-and-forget will find the ride finalized.
- **`POST /api/plan/reforecast`** was a printed-advisory no-op in v3.5.1; now actually shifts future hard sessions based on TSB.
- **CSP / X-Frame-Options / X-Content-Type-Options** headers now set on all responses. External tools that injected JS into the dashboard (bookmarklets, dev browser extensions) may break.
- **`CC_LOG_MAX_BYTES` / `CC_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` env vars** deprecated (still work with a warning); use **`DOMESTIQUE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` / `DOMESTIQUE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT`**.
- **FIT file output** now includes a `LapMessage`. Strava is tolerant; TP / Garmin Connect display totals correctly. Older FIT viewers that don't handle Laps may render differently.
- **Unsigned DMG / EXE** — macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen will block the first launch. README has the right-click → Open workaround. Codesigning is a documented future TODO.

### Security
- **XSS hardening** — migrated all `esc()`-in-`onclick` sites in `templates/dashboard.html` to `data-*` + event delegation or `escJs()` (killed 18+ potential-injection points incl. nutrition-product delete). Closed 7 additional `innerHTML` sinks in `templates/training.html` via `escHtml()`.
- **CSP + X-Content-Type-Options + X-Frame-Options** middleware added (`default-src 'self'`, style/script `'unsafe-inline'`, data: imgs, ws: WS).
- **/ws/training now validates Origin** before `websocket.accept()`.
- **Plan endpoints stopped leaking `str(e)`** in 500 responses; internal detail logged, client gets "Plan update failed".
- **/api/setup/save path allowlist** — workout/gpx/food-log dirs must live under `$HOME`, `~/.domestique`, or `/tmp`.
- **db.`_maybe_add_column`** validates identifiers against `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` — SQLi latent path closed.
- Root dev `.env` deleted pre-publish; ICU API keys live per-profile (chmod 0600) with README SECURITY note.
- Relay Worker: origin gate moved before OPTIONS preflight.

### Removed (dormant since v3.5.0)
- `/api/strava/*` endpoints (7 routes).
- `strava_client.py`, `strava_uploader.py`.
- `routes.json.bak`, `routes.json.surface_bak`, `sports_nutrition_db.json.bak`, `off_sports_nutrition.json`.
- Stale `dist/ChickenCycling*`, `dist/Health Tracker*`, `build/chickencycling/`, `build/health_tracker/` artefacts.
- `logs/chickencycling.log`, `logs/health_tracker.log`.

### Backend / correctness
- `_session_lock` + `_snapshot_session_surfaces()` guard concurrent mutation of `_training_session`; `_dispatch_road_feel` now snapshots surfaces safely.
- Wellness `ctl`/`atl` use `is not None` (0 is a real value, not "missing").
- ZWO Duration parsed via `int(float(...))` (tolerates fractional durations).
- `/api/logs` tail uses seek-from-end; bounded memory.
- ICU `raw_json` JSON-parsed before `isinstance` check.
- `ride_storage.py` HR cutoffs now reuse `zones.hr_zones()` — no 1-bpm drift.
- Save-ride validator simplified to `{name, private}`; rejects unknown fields with 422.
- Plan-write race closed: 7 plan-write sites in `app.py` wrapped in `training_planner.plan_write_lock()`.
- Timezone math normalized (`today.isocalendar()` uses `zoneinfo`; tz-aware/naive subtraction safe).
- `/api/version` minimal; no `platform.platform()` leak.
- `_VERSION` single-source reads `VERSION` file with BOM-safe encoding.

### Live ride + RIDE REPORT
- Peak HR bucket now uses per-bucket `hMax` (was bucket mean).
- `alert()` → `_rrToast()` (no more pywebview UI freezes on 409).
- RIDE REPORT SVGs responsive (viewBox + 100% width) — no hardcoded pixel widths.
- `pollDeviceStatus` in-flight guard + `beforeunload` cleanup.
- WebSocket reconnect resets interpolation state.
- `togglePause` awaits server truth instead of flipping local state eagerly.
- Keyboard shortcuts guarded by `_RR.visible` so ride summary can't trigger pause/resume.
- CSS cache invalidates on theme change.
- `renderElevationProfile` uses manual min/max loop (no 10k-arg spread).
- Pause auto-ends ride after 30 min.
- **New** `GET /api/training/session` returns current session snapshot (browser refresh mid-ride can re-mount).
- `/api/training/start` returns 404 on missing course file (no silent fall-through to free-mode).
- Gzip middleware reduces `/stop` payload for long rides.

### Planner / weekly / workout variety
- `daily_adapt` is TSB-aware (drops intensity a level when TSB < -30).
- 48h HIT-gap check now rolls across week boundaries.
- Workout-picker seed is local `random.Random(sha1(date:profile_id))` — different athletes no longer see identical picks.
- Empty candidate pool raises `NoCandidateWorkoutError` (was silent `zwo_file=""`).
- `reforecast()` is no longer a printed-advisory no-op — shifts future hard sessions by TSB.
- Rest-week adherence grades 100 → 0% across 0–50 TSS (was collapsing to 0 on any load).
- Sport-aware adherence now covers running in addition to cycling.
- Calendar null `session_type` guarded.
- `checkPlanGaps` POST body harmonized with `reforecastPlan`.

### Routes / surfaces
- **`surface_types.json` lookup fixed** end-to-end — flat `{region/slug: [segments]}` shape; `app.py` now keys with `route["id"]` verbatim; Tacx road-feel now actually fires.
- `generate_route_profiles.py` writes to `/tmp/` (was targeting prod `routes.json` and would have wiped the 622-entry catalog on accidental run).
- `build_preview_profile` length-guarded against short elevation arrays (was IndexError).
- `pick_weighted` empty/all-zero safe.
- `build_route_from_sections` merges tiny sections < 0.5 km before inflation.
- `surface_at` uses exclusive-upper bound + "unknown" fallback.
- `_detect_climbs` caps 4%-tail absorption.
- GPX `<ele>` missing/empty warns + per-file try/except (one bad file doesn't halt batch).
- `generate_procedural_routes.py` totals includes `"unknown"` bucket.
- Single-source haversine in new `geodesy.py` (4 duplicate copies eliminated).
- `_detect_climbs` deduped across `route_archetypes.py` + `generate_procedural_routes.py`.
- 3 gravel-archetype xfails fixed (tests pass without masking).

### Trainer / FIT
- `fit_activity.py`: LapMessage added to the FIT writer; fallback `start_time = now() - timedelta(seconds=dur)`; unused Garmin epoch offset removed; bare-excepts log at DEBUG.
- HR GATT 0x2A37 contact bits per spec (bit1 detected / bit2 supported).
- ERG `set_target(0)` → `disengage()` (avoids trainer-freewheel lock).
- Staleness watchdog now schedules reconnect + latches.
- ANT+ `_scan_ant` classifies device-type (0x11 power, 0x78 HR, 0x17 FE-C) — no longer hardcoded to `ANT_FEC/TRAINER`.
- BLE connect retry catches `BleakError` (bleak 3.x).
- `ANTHRMonitor` gained `on_disconnect`.
- Battery-level BLE reads on connect (optional).
- `ConnectionState.SCANNING` actually reachable.
- `disconnect_all()` releases ANT USB dongle.
- FTMS `cancel_spindown` sends reset opcode.
- Speed preserved across flag-bit-0 follow-up frames.
- Cadence debounce (ignore 0-drops <2s).
- ANT+ elapsed-time 64s rollover accumulates.
- Reconnect dedup + RSSI-sort ignores ANT+ zero-RSSI.
- `_reconnect_device` + staleness + logs cleaned.

### Nutrition
- Atwater self-correction at load (9 of 284 seed rows had declared kcal wildly off; replaced with 4C+4P+9F).
- Server validator requires all 4 macros (carbs/protein/fat/alcohol) with non-negative bounds.
- Caffeine cap 400mg/serving (was 2000mg — lethal range).
- Alcohol tracking at 7 kcal/g.
- Reminder window off-by-one fixed.

### Profile / zones
- `profile_manager.switch()` blocks during active ride; refreshes workout-picker's `WORKOUT_DIR` + clears lru_cache.
- `zones.estimated_hr_max(age)` Tanaka fallback (208 − 0.7×age).

### Packaging / docs
- `domestique.spec` reads `VERSION` at build time (was hardcoded "3.0.0").
- PyInstaller stale py_modules list cleaned up.
- `requirements.txt` — `bleak`, `pycycling`, `openant` uncommented (load-bearing for trainer); fastapi/starlette/pydantic upper bounds.
- `NOTICE` adds html2canvas + 5 runtime deps; nutrition count corrected to 284.
- `README.md` — workout 1,753 / route 622 counts corrected; SECURITY section; "Installing the unsigned DMG" workaround note.
- `SYSTEM.md` — data-dir and removed-Strava copy cleaned.
- `SCIENCE_REVIEW.md` title now "Domestique".
- `CHANGELOG.md` — 3.5.0 / 3.5.1 date order fixed.
- `DOMESTIQUE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` / `DOMESTIQUE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` env vars (with deprecated `CC_LOG_*` fallback).
- `launcher.py` signal handler flips uvicorn `should_exit` for graceful shutdown.
- `asyncio.create_task` strong-refs via module-level set.

### Tests
- New regression tests for: wellness ctl=0, save-ride validator, db column-name validation, session-lock race.
- 3 xfailed gravel archetypes fixed; no more xfails.
- Final suite: **609 passed, 1 skipped, 11 deselected** (baseline was 571/1/3).

### Commits
- 16 commits on `clean-release`, tagged `v3.6.0`.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-04-18

Save FIT button — download activity as FIT for manual upload to Strava / Garmin / etc.

### Added
- **"📦 Save FIT"** button on the RIDE REPORT footer (between Save-to-Desktop and SAVE). Hits new `GET /api/training/active-fit`, which renders the in-memory `_training_session` buffer through `fit_activity.build_activity_fit()` (same FIT shape used by the dormant Strava uploader) and streams the bytes back as `application/octet-stream` with a `Content-Disposition` filename `domestique-<profile-slug>-<iso-ts>.fit`. The session buffer is left intact, so SAVE / Discard still work afterwards. 409 when no active buffer exists.
- New `_rrSaveFit()` JS handler in `templates/training.html` — fetches the endpoint, parses the filename out of the `Content-Disposition` header, and triggers a browser download.

### Commits
- `v3.5.1` + Save FIT button on RIDE REPORT

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-17

Removed Strava UX (configuration friction); added Save-to-Desktop on RIDE REPORT.

### Removed
- **Settings → Connections → Strava** — entire Strava UI block in `templates/dashboard.html` is gone (Connect button, connected pill, re-auth chip, bootstrap modal, and the `connectStrava` / `promptStravaBootstrap` / `startStravaPolling` / `loadStravaStatus` / `disconnectStrava` JS functions). Intervals.icu connection is unchanged.
- **RIDE REPORT visibility pill (Private / Strava)** in `templates/training.html`, plus the screenshot preview thumbnail and `_rrCaptureScreenshot` / `_rrClearShot` / `_rrOpenStravaSettings` / `_rrSetVisibility` / `_rrRefreshStravaStatus` helpers and the `_RR.postToStrava` / `_RR.shotB64` / `_RR.stravaConnected` state.
- Save POST body simplified to `{name, private}` (defaults `private: true`).

### Added
- **"📥 Save to Desktop"** button on the RIDE REPORT footer (next to Discard + SAVE). New `_rrSaveToDesktop()` JS function uses the existing `_rrLoadHtml2Canvas()` lazy loader to render `#ride-report-card` to a 2x PNG and trigger a browser download (`domestique-<safe-name>-<iso-ts>.png`). The PNG lands in the user's default Downloads folder; from there they can drag it to Desktop. (A true "Save As… → Desktop" dialog requires the File System Access API, which is not available in pywebview reliably.)

### Changed
- **`POST /api/training/save-ride` validator** — `post_to_strava` and `screenshot_b64` are now optional (default `None`). Legacy clients that still send them continue to work; current UI just sends `{name, private}`.

### Kept (dormant)
- `/api/strava/*` endpoints, `strava_client.py`, `strava_uploader.py`, `relay/`, `surge_config.py`, and `keychain.py` Strava entries are untouched. Easy to revive if the user changes their mind.

### Commits
- `v3.5.0` rm Strava UX + Save-to-Desktop on RIDE REPORT

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Strava OAuth relay (Cloudflare Worker)** — true reference-parity UX: end-users no longer need to paste a Strava `client_secret`. A tiny single-file Worker (`relay/strava-oauth-worker.js`) holds the secret server-side and exposes `POST /token-exchange`, `POST /token-refresh`, and `GET /health`. CORS is locked to Domestique's `localhost:8080` / `127.0.0.1:8080` origins; input shape (code/refresh_token) is validated at the edge; per-(colo,IP) token-bucket rate limit; logs contain only timestamps + status codes (never the secret, never any token).
- **`STRAVA_RELAY_URL` config** in `surge_config.py` — sourced from `DOMESTIQUE_STRAVA_RELAY_URL` env var. When set, `is_relay_configured()` returns True and `is_strava_configured()` returns True without needing a local secret.
- **`relay/wrangler.toml` + `relay/README.md`** — 5-minute one-time deploy guide (cloudflare.com → Workers → paste code → set `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` + `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars → deploy → copy URL).

### Changed
- **`strava_client.exchange_code()`** — when relay is configured, POSTs `{code}` to `{STRAVA_RELAY_URL}/token-exchange`; otherwise falls through to the direct Strava call (dev / pre-relay installs).
- **`strava_client.get_valid_access_token()`** — refresh leg uses `{STRAVA_RELAY_URL}/token-refresh` when configured, otherwise direct.
- **`/api/strava/oauth-start`** — drops the 503 "App secret not configured" branch when the relay is configured (the `/authorize` step itself only needs the public `client_id`).

### Tests
- `test_strava_relay.py` — six cases covering relay-configured vs unconfigured detection, exchange routing, refresh routing, and direct-call fallback. Stubs `requests.post` via `unittest.mock` (no `responses` dependency added).

### Commits
- `v3.4.0` Strava OAuth relay (Cloudflare Worker) for reference-parity UX

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Sport-aware adherence on Home → "This Week"** — a planned cycling workout (Z2, SS, TEMPO, FTP, VO2, OU, REC) is now considered DONE only if the day has at least one cycling activity (`Ride`, `VirtualRide`, `EBikeRide`). Doing a hike/run/swim on a planned SS day no longer credits the cycling session away; it is now correctly listed in `missed_sessions` with `did_non_cycling: true`. The day cell still shows the actual exposure badge (so the cross-training credit is visible) but adds a red `plan: SS missed` subtitle.
- **`planned_days_done` / `planned_days_missed`** are computed against the same sport-aware rule, so the Adherence pill ("3 of 5 planned sessions done") matches what the user feels.

### Added
- **`exposure_minutes_planned` field** on `/api/week-summary` — backend maps each planned `session_type` to its expected band (`recovery`/`z2`/`long_z2` → low_aerobic, `tempo` → mid_aerobic, `sweetspot`/`threshold` → high_aerobic, `vo2max`/`overunder` → anaerobic, `rest` → none) and attributes `duration_min` to that band.
- **Planned vs Actual exposure bars** in the weekly rollup — two stacked bars: top labeled "Planned" (70% opacity, dashed-border outline = the target), bottom labeled "Actual" (full opacity = what you did). Combined legend below: `LOW 660m planned / 328m actual` per band.
- **Make-it-up nudge** in the missed-sessions modal — when `did_non_cycling` is true, the row shows "Did non-cycling activity that day — make it up?" in orange italic.

### Commits
- `v3.3.0` weekly summary — sport-aware adherence + planned vs actual exposure

## [3.2.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Strava one-button connect (reference-parity UX)** — single click on the Strava tile launches the OAuth flow in the system browser, polls for completion, and reflects connected state in the UI without page reload.
- **First-time bootstrap modal** — when no app secret is configured, a modal prompts for the Strava client secret and stores it in the macOS Keychain (service `domestique.strava`, account `app-secret`). Plaintext config is never written.
- **Per-profile token storage** — one installed app supports N profiles, each with its own Strava athlete. Tokens are scoped by `profile_id` in the Keychain so switching profiles does not cross-contaminate uploads.
- **Polling-based callback** — pywebview cannot deliver `postMessage` from the OAuth popup back to the parent. The callback HTML now renders a simple "you can close this tab" page; the dashboard polls `/api/strava/status` to detect completion.

### Fixed
- **XSS escape** in `/api/strava/oauth-callback` — the `error` query param is HTML-escaped before being rendered (previously raw-interpolated). Verified with `?error=<svg/onload=alert(1)>` → renders as `&lt;svg/onload=alert(1)&gt;`.
- **Popup-blocker workaround** — `window.open` is invoked synchronously inside the click handler so Safari/Chrome do not block the OAuth window.
- **Version sync** — `/api/version` literal, `VERSION` file, and bundle Info.plist now all read `3.2.1`.
- **Status cache** — `/api/strava/status` no longer holds a stale "connected" flag after token expiry; it re-checks the Keychain each call.

### Commits
- `f20d284` v3.2.1: QA fixes — XSS escape, popup-blocker, version bump, status cache
- `79bcf34` v3.2.0: Strava bootstrap secret + reference-parity callback HTML
- `17789bd` v3.2.0: Strava one-button connect (reference-parity UX)
- `fdd7485` v3.0.3: cache-bust favicon (?v=3) so browsers pick up the cyclist logo
- `f87cd52` v3.0.2: cyclist climbing zone-colored steps logo
- `a401a7e` v3.0.1: classic castle silhouette logo (3 towers + cone roofs + portcullis)

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Data directory renamed**: `~/.chickencycling/` → `~/.domestique/`. A one-time migration runs on first boot via `profile_manager._maybe_migrate_data_dir()` and uses `shutil.move`, so existing profiles, SQLite DB, ride history, intervals.icu credentials, and known-device registry all carry over automatically. The legacy directory no longer exists after migration.
- **Logger names**: `chickencycling.*` → `domestique.*` (`profiles`, `rides`, `nutrition`, `nutrition_db`, `food`).
- **Log file**: `~/.domestique/logs/domestique.log` (was `chickencycling.log`).

### Added
- **macOS Keychain for Strava tokens.** `keychain.py` wraps the macOS `security` CLI. On macOS, Strava OAuth tokens (access + refresh) are stored under service `domestique.strava` (account = profile_id) instead of plaintext `strava.json`. Existing `strava.json` files are auto-migrated into the Keychain on first read, then unlinked. Non-macOS hosts keep the 0600 JSON-file fallback.

### Migration safety
- **Backup before upgrade**: a snapshot of the legacy data dir was taken at `~/.chickencycling.v2-backup/` before the v3.0.0 rename. If anything goes sideways, restore with `mv ~/.chickencycling.v2-backup ~/.chickencycling` and downgrade.

### Notes
- Bumped FastAPI app version + `/api/version` payload to `3.0.0`. Bundle Info.plist `CFBundleShortVersionString` updated to match.
- The v2 single-user → multi-profile migration (`migrate_profiles.py`) now operates on the new `~/.domestique/` path. Order in `app.py` lifespan: `ProfileManager.get()` (v3 dir rename) THEN `migrate_to_profiles()` (legacy v1 → v2 layout).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-17

### Renamed
- **ChickenCycling → Domestique.** New tagline: **"Your training domestique."**
- macOS bundle id: `com.chickencycling.app` → `com.platypus45.domestique`
- DMG output: `ChickenCycling.dmg` → `Domestique.dmg`
- PyInstaller spec: `chickencycling.spec` → `domestique.spec`
- Window title, tray-icon title, and printed banners now read "Domestique"

### Added
- **RIDE REPORT** — one-screen end-ride flow: cadence, MMP (mean-max power) curve, and aerobic decoupling all on a single review surface before save/discard.
- **`POST /api/training/save-ride`** — single save endpoint with editable title, visibility (private/followers/public), and one optional screenshot attachment. Replaces the prior multi-step save flow.
- **Strava OAuth + activity upload** — full OAuth 2.0 flow plus FIT-format activity push with `trainer=true` flag and optional photo attach. Modules: `strava_client.py`, `strava_uploader.py`, `fit_activity.py`.
- **Settings → Connections** panel — manage Strava and intervals.icu credentials in one place (connect, disconnect, status badge).
- **Castle logo** — Z1–Z6 stacked colour blocks with Z5/Z6 surge upward. Ships as `static/icon.svg`, `static/icon.png`, `static/favicon.png`, `static/apple-touch-icon.png`.

### Notes
- **Data directory unchanged.** `~/.chickencycling/` is intentionally **kept** so the SQLite DB, profiles, ride history, intervals.icu credentials, and known-device registry survive the rebrand without re-onboarding. A future migration to `~/.domestique/` is wired through the `profile_manager._maybe_migrate_data_dir()` seam (no-op today).
- **Strava attribution.** To get the "via Domestique" line on uploaded activities, register Domestique with `developers@strava.com` (FIT manufacturer/product registration). Until then uploads land without a third-party attribution badge but otherwise function normally.
- DB table names, route IDs, intervals.icu credential helpers, and Python logger names are unchanged.
- Existing `<author>ChickenCycling</author>` headers inside bundled `workouts/*.zwo` and `courses/**/*.crs` are preserved as historical artifacts; only newly generated files emit `Domestique`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Setup wizard**: 5-step first-launch configuration (Intervals.icu, Strava/Garmin migration, athlete profile, data paths, training preferences)
- **Desktop app packaging**: PyInstaller spec for macOS .app and Windows .exe, launcher with system tray icon
- **Workout classifier rewrite**: 10 clean categories (Endurance, Sweet Spot, Threshold, VO2max, Anaerobic, Sprint, Over-Unders, Tempo, Recovery, Mixed) — classifies by training stimulus, not dominant zone
- **Weekly plan variety**: workout library rotation ensures different workouts each week across the entire plan
- **Interactive elevation profiles**: hover crosshair showing gradient %, distance, and elevation in course and virtual route detail modals
- **CRS file format fix**: all 487 files converted from cumulative to delta distances for GoldenCheetah compatibility
