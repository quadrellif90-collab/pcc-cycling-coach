"""Structure fidelity — "did you ride the SHAPE that was prescribed?"

Advisory axis for post-ride evaluation (companion to execution_score, which
grades duration/TSS/time-in-zone only and cannot see structural failures:
10 of 13 prescribed reps, a smeared ERG square wave, or a skipped final
block all survive TiZ + TSS nearly intact). This module compares the
PRESCRIBED .zwo segment timeline against the DELIVERED 1 Hz power trace
and produces a per-rep fidelity result.

Pure + deterministic, stdlib only. The only I/O helper is
:func:`parse_zwo_file` (thin wrapper for callers); everything else takes
plain values. No numpy, no DTW — a coarse global alignment plus per-segment
window statistics, tuned so a normally-lagged ERG execution scores clean.

Prescribed side — :func:`parse_zwo_text`:
  Parses the small ZWO dialect used by the library (stdlib xml.etree) into
  an ABSOLUTE segment timeline. Tags: Warmup, SteadyState, Ramp, IntervalsT
  (expanded Repeat × on/off), Cooldown, FreeRide. Each segment is a dict
  {"kind", "start_s", "dur_s", "lo", "hi"} where lo/hi are the FTP-fraction
  targets at segment start/end (steady: lo == hi; FreeRide: both None).
  Warmup/Cooldown/Ramp all ramp lo=PowerLow → hi=PowerHigh, matching the
  library's own generated descriptions ("Cooldown: 5min from 38% to 49%").

Delivered side + matching — :func:`score_structure`:
  1. Target step function: per-second target watts from the timeline
     (linear interpolation inside ramps; FreeRide seconds undefined).
  2. Global alignment: offset o in ±ALIGN_MAX_OFFSET_S (1 s steps) that
     minimizes mean absolute error between target[t] and watts[t + o] —
     a cross-correlation-style search over the target step function vs the
     trace. Offsets whose overlap covers < max(60 s, half the defined
     target seconds) are skipped; no valid offset → o = 0. Positive o
     means the trace has o seconds of riding before the workout started.
  3. WORK segments: midpoint target (lo+hi)/2 >= WORK_FLOOR_FRAC (0.75 —
     everything from tempo up; recovery valleys, z2 and cooldowns are
     structure carriers, not graded reps). Per work segment, over the
     aligned window:
       * on_target_frac — fraction of seconds within the tolerance band
         |w − target| <= max(TOL_FRAC·target, TOL_MIN_W watts), after
         dropping the first TRANSIENT_GRACE_S seconds of the segment
         (ERG controllers need 2-3 s to close on a new step; that lag is
         normal execution, not infidelity — a 10 s+ smear still shows).
       * mean_ratio — delivered mean watts / target mean watts.
       * missing — the rep was not ridden: absent-or-below-floor seconds
         exceed MISSING_BELOW_FLOOR_FRAC of the prescribed duration,
         where the floor is min(WORK_FLOOR_FRAC, MISSING_TARGET_FRAC ×
         midpoint) × FTP (the second term keeps a tempo rep ridden 2 %
         under target from being called skipped) and seconds past the end
         of the trace count as absent (rider stopped).

Result dict (field names are the contract, pinned by tests):

    "reps_prescribed":    int,          # work segments in the timeline
    "reps_delivered":     int,          # prescribed − missing

                                        # reps count as 0.0), same row
                                        # shape as "segments" entries
    "segments":           list[dict],   # per work segment: {"index",
                                        # "start_s", "dur_s", "target_frac",
                                        # "mean_ratio", "on_target_frac",
                                        # "missing"}
  }
:func:`score_structure` returns None when it cannot honestly grade:
no segments, no watts, unusable FTP, or a timeline with zero work
segments (pure endurance rides have no reps to count).

Block grading — :func:`score_blocks`:
  A different question, off different data: "which prescribed BLOCKS did I
  actually do?" The rider marks a lap per block and intervals.icu returns
  each lap with the offset on the ride clock where it started, so no 1 Hz
  trace and no FTP value are needed.

  Four earlier versions inferred which lap was which block from the shape of
  the lap alone, and each shipped a different class of confident wrong
  verdict — an abandoned session certified complete, a block ridden harder
  than asked reported unridden, a completed block called missing because the
  recoveries ran long. All of those readings are admissible from shape. The
  offsets are what rules them out, and they are the whole difference.

  The alignment runs over SLOTS — the blocks plus every other prescribed
  stretch at or above the work floor, since a head unit types a lead-in
  effort or a warm-up ramp step "work" too and a block will otherwise steal
  its lap. It scores block-seconds explained (above a quality floor, so a
  poor pairing is worth less than none) less a cost per step for the gap
  between one slot and the next running differently from the plan. That cost
  is measured against the pace THIS rider is keeping — fitted once from the
  session's own recoveries — so stretching every recovery costs nothing,
  while stretching one costs, which is what a block gone by looks like.

  Then four gates, any of which returns None rather than a verdict: a block
  whose reading is not decisively better than the opposite reading; a block
  called unridden with a lap that could have been it sitting spare; a lap
  read as one block while it sits on top of another; and a lap spanning a
  run of blocks, which is a lap-button press that never happened and cannot
  be recovered. A missing report is recoverable. A false green tick is not.

    Answers the question a load number cannot: "I stopped early — which blocks
    did I do?" Laps carry the offset on the ride clock where each one started
    (persisted from intervals.icu), so the delivered ride is a timeline the
    prescription can be checked against.

    The rule that survived six generations of this feature: a block gets a
    verdict on IDENTITY or on PROOF OF ABSENCE, and on nothing else.

    * Identity: an anchored block — its own run, at its intensity, where the
      session's clock puts it — is ridden, and its run's length says done or
      partial. Over-length and over-intensity stay "done": harder or longer
      is still doing the block.
    * Proof of absence: an unanchored block is "missed" only when its window
      shows nothing but clearly-easy riding (below 60 % of the block's
      target) or lies beyond the end of the ride, AND no unclaimed run
      anywhere order-consistent could have been the block.
    * Anything else — a window in the gray band, a spare run that fits, a
      clock that reads two ways — is a question the recording does not
      answer, and the whole session goes ungraded. A missing report is
      recoverable; a false green tick is not.
