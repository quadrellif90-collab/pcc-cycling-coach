    auto-swap — decoupling is less reliable than DFA α1 and is confounded by
    ride duration, heat and fuelling.

    The v1.8.16 live bug: a 5-day-old 9.9% reading advised Z2 while TSB was +17,
    readiness GOOD, DFA healthy α1=1.126. The defect was that a days-old number
    presented itself as *current* ("Recent ride showed…"). v1.8.16 fixed it by
    discarding anything over 2 days old; v3.6.0 fixes it by saying how old it is.

    Gates (v3.6.0):

      1. RECENCY, graded. Over ``_DECOUPLING_MAX_AGE_DAYS`` (10) → dropped as
         ``stale``. Inside it, ``confidence`` is ``fresh`` (≤3d), ``aging``
         (≤10d) or ``unknown`` (age not known → keep, fail toward warning), and
         an ``aging`` reading is phrased with its age so it can never read as
         today's. The old 2-day cut silenced the signal after a single rest day,
         which is exactly when a fatigue reading is worth seeing.
      2. FORM VETO — **fresh readings only**, and **gated on DFA corroboration**:
         suppress when form is fresh (``tsb ≥ +5`` OR status ∈ {GOOD, EXCELLENT})
         AND DFA independently confirms freshness (``dfa_present_and_healthy``).
         Two deliberate restrictions:
           * When DFA is ABSENT/insufficient — the common case, most rides have
             no RR — decoupling is the only acute signal and TSB lags acute
             fatigue ~7d, so a fresh TSB alone is NOT grounds to silence it.
           * An ``aging`` reading is not vetoed at all. Vetoing it would make
             the wider window pointless: the cases the window exists to surface
             are exactly the ones a good TSB would have hidden.

    Display-only in every path: no caller mutates a plan from this result
    (verified across the planner, the continuous policy, the calendar push and
    the live-session module). The v1.8.16 note that this "advised Z2" describes
    the banner copy, not a plan change.
