- FastFitness.tips classification heuristic (also used by intervals.icu).

Domestique uses the FastFitness.tips formulation
``PI = log10((Z1+Z2 + Z5+) / Z3+Z4)`` — equivalent in spirit to Treff
(emphasises the easy/hard ratio over the moderate band) and matches the
single ``polarization_index`` value ICU reports on the activity GET, which
keeps the Domestique number consistent with what the user already sees in
intervals.icu.

Classification (v1.8.0 PI-BAND CASCADE):
PI-band rules per Treff 2019, replacing the centroid-distance heuristic so
the Treff reference ride (15/49.2/35.8) lands on `pyramidal` rather than the
old `hiit @ 1% confidence` mis-classification. Evaluate top-down, first match
wins. Centroid centres are retained only for confidence scoring.

    Threshold is evaluated BEFORE pyramidal so that a high-z3z4 / low-z5+
    / moderate-z1z2 distribution (e.g. 30/60/10) lands on `threshold`
    rather than `pyramidal`. The Treff reference ride (15/49.2/35.8) has
    enough z5+ to skip threshold and is caught by the strict pyramidal
    rule. v1.8.3 adds rule #6 (moderate pyramidal) to catch real-world
    endurance rides like 58.3/27.6/14.1 that ICU's FastFitness.Tips
    labels Pyramidaal but the strict z3z4>=35 rule misses.

    v2.0.2 — rule 1b. The displayed PI (and ICU's) is the *multiplicative*
    Treff PI (`treff_polarization_index`), but the legacy gate (rule 1a)
    tests the *additive* `pi`. A Rønnestad ride 58.0/10.7/31.3 has additive
    PI 0.92 (never fires 1a) yet Treff PI 2.23 — ICU labels it Polarized,
    Domestique mislabelled it "unique". Rule 1b reconciles: it fires on the
    SAME Treff PI the UI shows, gated by a real hard pole (z5+ >= 20) over a
    suppressed middle (z3z4 < z5+) so it captures the genuine two-pole shape
    WITHOUT pulling in easy base rides like 80/5/15 (Treff PI 2.38 but z5+
    only 15) that the unguarded multiplicative cutoff would wrongly flag.

    DFA α1 is acutely sensitive to ectopic / missed / inserted beats: even
    ~1% corruption injects uncorrelated high-frequency variance that (a) drags
    α1 toward the 0.5 white-noise floor and (b) breaks the log-log scaling
    region so the per-window R² ≥ 0.95 gate then rejects most windows — which
    silently destroys both the whole-ride average AND the per-window series /
    LT1-minutes. Real example from validation (v1.8.14): a 63-min ride at
    142 bpm avg computed α1 = 0.573 over only 15 valid windows UNFILTERED
    (physiologically impossible — implies the whole ride sat above anaerobic
    threshold); after this filter, α1 = 1.16 over 72 windows (correct: mostly
    aerobic, dipping at hard efforts). Only 1.3 % of beats were dropped.

    Drops any RR differing from the median of its ±2 surrounding beats by more
    than ``rel_thresh``. This is the Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) / Kubios

    standard.

    v2.2.10 FIX — history of two earlier, wrong reference choices:
      * **last-ACCEPTED beat** (the bug this replaces): cascades catastrophically.
        A single bad early beat (sentinel/dropout) or even a stitched step in the
        stream makes the accepted reference stick far from the signal, so every
        following beat reads >20% off it → up to ~99% of beats dropped → 0 DFA
        windows → a bogus "no_rr_data" and a blank DFA panel.
      * **previous beat** (Malik 1996 successive-difference): kills the cascade but
        (a) over-rejects at high intensity — short RR + large relative jitter — which
        drops the α1-vs-load fit r² below the threshold gate so HRVT1/HRVT2 stop
        resolving, and (b) drops the clean recovery beat after an ectopic (the
        compensatory pause shifts the reference), ~3 drops per ectopic doublet.
    A local MEDIAN is robust to the outlier under test, to a smooth HR trend, and
    to the post-ectopic recovery beat: no cascade, ~half the high-intensity

# ── v1.8.2 — planned-vs-actual ride comparison ──────────────────────────────
#
# `compare_plan_to_actual(planned_session, actual_ride)` returns the locked
# 6-field dict per MATCH-B design. Used by `_summarize_ride_for_calendar` to
# attach a `compare` block to each calendar day-row so the UI can render a
# "matched / extended / truncated / different / no_plan" badge.
#
# Decision rules:
#   * `zone_distribution_match` = cosine similarity on the 3-vec
#     [z1z2_pct, z3z4_pct, z5plus_pct]. Cosine (not MSE) is shape-invariant
#     so a longer ride at the same blend still scores high — exactly the
#     "extended" intent.
#   * `tss_delta_pct` threshold = ±25 % per Foster C (1998) "Monitoring
#     training in athletes with reference to overtraining syndrome." Med Sci
#     Sports Exerc 30(7):1164-1168. The same 25 %/1.5× constant gates
#     `_detect_plan_load_alert`'s acute-load spike check.
#   * `duration_delta_min` threshold = ±15 min — small enough that a normal
#     warm-down extension doesn't trigger "extended", large enough that
#     bailing out 20 min early reads as "truncated".
#   * `zone_dist_match_min` = 0.7, `zone_dist_different_max` = 0.5. The
#     0.5-0.7 shoulder is treated as `matched` (avoids false
#     "different_workout" calls on the noisy `_planned_zone_split_minutes`
#     heuristic).
#   * Missing planned → `no_plan`. Missing actual → `missed`. Rest-day +
#     spontaneous ride → `no_plan` (the ride wasn't the plan).
