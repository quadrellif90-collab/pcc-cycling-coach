"""Execution scoring — "did you ride what was prescribed?" (P2.1, G10).

Pure module: :func:`score_ride` takes the planned session dict, a full ride
record and the athlete's target_mode and returns a 0-100 execution score with
per-axis components and a verdict. NO file/DB access in here — callers fetch
(app.py re-fetches the full ride by activity_id at completion-match time,
because the week-activities collector strips time-in-zone).

Model v1 (deliberately coarse, contract G10):
  duration_ratio  = ride_duration / planned_duration
  load_ratio      = ride_tss / planned_tss
  intensity_ratio = (fraction of ride TiZ in the session's PRESCRIBED band)
                    / (expected in-band fraction for that session type)
  score = round(100 * (0.3*dur + 0.3*load + 0.4*intensity))  with each
          component CAPPED at 1 for the score; the VERDICT derives from the
          UNCAPPED ratios (thresholds locked in tests). Missing axes drop out
          and the remaining weights renormalize (load_only ⇒ 0.5/0.5).

Zone-bucket mapping (test-locked table below):
  * The ride's power ``time_in_zone`` is the canonical {z1..z7} dict
    (ride_storage normalized shape). The overlapping ``ss`` accumulator is
    EXCLUDED everywhere — it double-counts z3/z4 time and would corrupt both
    the numerator and the denominator.
  * sweetspot straddle: SS work (84-97 %FTP) spans the Coggan z3/z4 boundary
    at 90 %, so the band is {z3, z4} — a rider sitting at either side of the
    90 % line is not split-penalized.
  * overunder straddle: unders (~90-95 %) are z4, overs (~105-110 %) poke into
    z5, so the band is {z4, z5}.
  * Expected fractions are the plausible in-band share of a well-executed
    session of that type (intervals + recovery valleys + warmup/cooldown),
    calibrated against the library's typical structures. Locked by tests.
  * hr mode maps prescription rows onto the ICU HR-zone frame by bucket
    INDEX with a declared ±1-bucket tolerance (HR lag + the Coggan-power vs
    athlete-HR-zone frame mismatch). Types whose power band starts at z5+
    (vo2max/anaerobic) carry RPE cues in hr mode (hr_targets returns RPE for
    zone >= 5), so with HR-only data they score duration+load only.
  * sprint/neuromuscular is ALWAYS load_only: sub-30 s max efforts are too
    short for TiZ to register a meaningful band fraction in either frame.

Basis selection (G3 — basis follows DATA present, prescription follows mode):
  power TiZ present  -> basis "power" (even when the app is in hr mode);
  else hr TiZ present AND the type is HR-guidable -> basis "hr";
  else -> basis "load_only" (duration + load axes only).

Structure fidelity (advisory axis, additive — see structure_fidelity.py):
  score_ride's result carries a "fidelity" key comparing the prescribed
  .zwo segment timeline against the delivered 1 Hz watts trace (per-rep
  completion + on-target accounting). It is computed ONLY when the caller
  provides planned_segments (parse_zwo_text output — this module stays
  I/O-free) plus a watts trace and FTP, either as keyword args or embedded
  in the ride record (ride["streams"]["watts"|"power"], ride["ftp_at_ride"]
  / ["eftp_at_ride"]); otherwise it is None. It NEVER contributes to
  score/verdict — those semantics stay locked.
