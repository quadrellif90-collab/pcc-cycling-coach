    Since v2.1.0, single-profile users who never opened the profile picker
    kept writing plans to the legacy ROOT ``~/.domestique/plans/`` while
    ``profiles/<id>/plans/`` held a frozen migration-day snapshot; the v3.0.0
    boot repoint then served the stale snapshot. This adopts the legacy root
    ``current_plan.json`` into the ACTIVE profile's plan dir, once.

    Discriminator (STAMP-primary, A-LOCKED-1): the plan's ``generated`` /
    ``generated_at`` stamp; newer stamp wins. mtime is the fallback ONLY when
    a stamp is missing/unparseable on either side (NEVER mtime-primary — the
    boot-time stale-classification rewrite restamps the profile file every
    3.0.x boot, so the mtime rule would no-op the fix for the whole victim
    cohort). Equal stamps: single-profile home adopts (wrong-skip is
    permanent+silent, wrong-adopt is .bak-recoverable); multi-profile skips.
    mtime tie: skip (profile wins; conservative).

    Adoption = rotate profile live → .bak chain, then ``copy2`` root → profile
    (mtime/stamp preserved); root's standard ``.bak..bak{depth}`` names are
    copied only where the profile has no file of that exact name (2.1.0
    migration already copied them → expected no-ops); foreign names
    (``.bak-v206`` etc.) are never touched. The root file is retired via
    ``Path.replace`` → ``current_plan.json.pre-v3`` (the idempotency latch,
    immune to restamps) only AFTER the copy succeeded. Byte-identical
    root == profile retires WITHOUT copy/rotation — this doubles as the
    retire-failure loop guard (a re-boot after a failed retire re-lands here).

    Corrupt root JSON: skip + warn, leave the file for support. Unparseable /
    zero-byte profile plan counts as "profile missing" (else the v1.6.2
    boot restore would resurrect a stale .bak over the adopted plan).

# https://… host); pinning the port added no CSRF protection while silently
# 403-ing every mutating POST when the app serves off-default (dev preview on

    The v1.0.6 IMPL-3D-MODEL wired strain_score.compute_xss_components into

    impulses into the fitness/fatigue curves the dashboard chart consumes.

    builds an oldest-first contiguous per-day load series for each

        v1.8.8 Bug 9 also tries the local FIT file (if any) so rides
        captured on a Garmin AND synced to ICU still backfill.

    'results': [{ride_id, skipped_reason}, ...],

    v1.8.9 Bug 3 (master §3): the aggregate_summary buckets the per-ride

    `without_power` (HR-only rides — common indoor/Zwift no-meter),
    `pre_cutoff` (predate the SS feature), `successfully_backfilled`
    (skipped_reason None). The existing per-ride `results` list stays.

    `?auto=1` query: server logs auto vs manual trigger so we can tell
    user-initiated runs apart from the dashboard's auto-kick on load.
    No behavioral difference.

    `skipped_reason` is one of:
      ``"no_power_stream"`` — fetch returned nothing
      ``"all_zero"``        — stream present but every sample == 0
      ``"fit_missing"``     — FIT-sourced ride but the .fit file is gone
      ``"cutoff"``          — ride pre-dates the SS feature cutoff

      - ``duration_min=30&duration_max=60`` — minutes; either bound optional.

        (lowercased, [-_/]→space, ø→o/×→x). Intent tokens are parsed out
        first: durations ("90min"/"1h30"/"1.5h" = ±12%; "<60"/">120"/
        "60-90" literal, intersected with the slider), structures

        strides/ladder/test — see _SEARCH_SYNONYMS), and a bounded
        Levenshtein-1 typo rescue over the class vocabulary. Family
        tokens keep pass-1 semantics: class-name PREFIX match
        (threshold → threshold + threshold_ladder), reverting to plain
        substring when an explicit ``content_class`` filter is active.
        Parsed intents echo back via ``X-Search-Intents`` and the
        highlightable tokens via ``X-Search-Tokens`` response headers.
      - ``sort=relevance|score_desc|score_asc|duration_desc|duration_asc|
        name_asc|name_desc`` — default ``score_desc``; ``relevance`` ranks
        by search score (no active search → duration_asc fallback).

    """Workout-of-the-day picker.

    v4.1.1 FIX-PICKER-MOVE (Bug D): two fixes land here.

    1. T5 (v4.1.0) added a ``tags: str = Query(None)`` parameter to
       ``api_workouts``. This endpoint calls ``api_workouts`` as a plain
       Python function — bypassing FastAPI's dependency injection — so
       unpassed params keep their ``Query(None)`` *default objects* as
       values. Inside ``api_workouts`` line 1015 then does
       ``if tags: tags.split(",")`` — the Query() object is truthy and
       has no ``.split`` → the entire call raised AttributeError and the
       endpoint 500'd, surfacing in the UI as "readiness ?/100; no
       workouts". We now pass ``tags=None`` explicitly.

    2. When the user is on a fresh install with no FIT/HRV data yet,
       ``compute_readiness`` returns ``score=None``. The old branch then
       returned an empty workouts list — not useful for a
       workout-picker UI. We now fall back to a neutral 70/100 baseline
       ("no HRV data yet") and proceed to surface z2/endurance
       suggestions so the user sees a sensible default set rather than
       a blank card on day one.

    Used by both the manual ``/api/plan/update`` button and the ride-sync auto
    path; BOTH pass ``gap_debounce=True`` (see the route at ~9533), so refits are
    latch-gated — at most one silent rebuild per absence EPISODE via
    ``plan["gap_regen_latch"]`` (and the missed-hard tier via
    ``plan["missed_refit_latch"]``).

    Guards (see /tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_tasks12 §11):
      • REPLACES reforecast — never regen-then-reforecast (mangles the ramp).
      • RECENT-gap gate — an old recovered gap does not trigger a rebuild.
      • EVENT-TAPER guard — inside max(21, taper) days of an event we never
        silently recompute the taper; we reforecast + flag "behind plan".
      • EPISODE latch — key = f"{first_missed_week}:{ramp_band}" so a rebuild
        fires only on a NEW or band-deepened absence, not every sync.

    Returns ``(plan_dict, action, info, status_message)`` where action is
    "rebuilt" | "rebalanced". Does NOT persist — the caller writes inside its
    own plan_write_lock so the latch/status writes are in the same critical

# thread, so there is no UX urgency. A ~3h Garmin Fenix 8 FIT carries
# 30k+ records and fit_tool parse takes ~20s; 5s was killing every
# real-world ride's DFA computation in a permanent retry loop (status
# 'timeout' is retry-eligible, but the next retry would also hit 5s

# "background daemon" the comment above assumes is not the path the Plan-tab
# catch-up overlay awaits. So a record that already failed once at 45s must NOT
# burn another 45s on every subsequent sync: re-tries of a 'timeout' record use
# a short cap, and after _DFA_MAX_TIMEOUT_RETRIES the 'timeout' status goes
