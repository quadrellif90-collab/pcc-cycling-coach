# The artifact carries pywebview's Qt/PySide6 backend, not GTK: QtWebEngine
# ships its own Chromium, so there is no host WebKitGTK to bundle, patch or
# track across the 4.0 -> 4.1 -> 6.0 churn. It costs ~272 MB and buys a
# download-and-run binary that is not tied to the Debian/Ubuntu family.
#
# Build host MUST be old enough for the reach we claim: build inside

# Building on 24.04 produces a binary 22.04 cannot load and buys nothing.
