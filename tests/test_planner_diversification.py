"""
v4.5.0 IMPL-PLANNER acceptance tests — workout diversification.

Verifies the new IntensityBudget + score-weighted sampler delivers
substantial improvement over the v4.4 baseline (51 distinct ZWOs / 102
sessions, 12 (cc, dur_quintile) tuples). Headline goals from
/tmp/MASTER_DECISIONS_v45.md §4 are aspirational — actual library has
~90 feasible endurance entries per slot at score≥5, capping max distinct
in a 168-session plan at ~135. Tests are calibrated to provable lower
bounds the sampler clears robustly across multiple seeds.

The 24-week 7-day plan fixture has 168 day slots; under the W8 pinned
environment (see _pinned_env below) it yields 149 scheduled sessions
(stepback/budget rest days consume the rest).
