"""v4.5.4 FIX-PLANNER-INTERVALS — interval-shape variety on a fresh 24-week plan.

User complaint #4: the plan looks like "diagonal blocks" because too many
weeks pick steady-state z2/tempo/recovery workouts and almost none of the
1500+ interval-shaped (4×8, 5×3, 30/30, sprints) library files. The fix
rebalances WORKOUT_MIX_PREFERENCE and adds a per-week interval-floor so the
sampler swaps in interval-shaped picks where steady picks would otherwise
dominate.

These tests pin the new behaviour:
  1. ≥2 interval-shaped picks per week in build1+build2+peak (was 0-1).
  2. ≥1 interval-shaped pick per week in mid/late base (was 0).
  3. ≥6 distinct interval content_classes appear across the plan.
  4. {threshold, vo2max, sweet_spot, over_under} all appear in build1+build2.
  5. {vo2_short, neuromuscular} → at least one appears in build2/peak.

"Interval-shaped" = content_class in {sweet_spot, threshold, vo2max,
vo2_short, over_under, anaerobic, neuromuscular} OR the workout is `mixed`
content with secondary_flags exposing interval structure (has_threshold_work
/has_vo2_work/has_sprints/pattern_microinterval/pattern_over_under).
