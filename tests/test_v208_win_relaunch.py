"""v2.1.0 — B1 (Windows app won't reopen after close). On Windows the webview
CLR/WinForms backend + the bound :8080 socket lingered after webview.start()
returned, so the process didn't die; the next launch saw an orphan server with no
window and opened a browser tab instead of reopening the app ("kill it in Task
Manager every single time"). Fix: launcher._win_hard_exit() best-effort-stops
uvicorn then os._exit(0) on win32; macOS (Cocoa, no CLR) is a no-op.

The Windows runtime path can't be exercised on macOS; these assert the helper's
logic with os._exit mocked.
