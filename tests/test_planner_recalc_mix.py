"""v2.0.3 F6 (T-RECALC-MIX) — recalculate_plan routes weeks through the sampler.

Before F6, ``recalculate_plan`` built future weeks via ``plan_week`` (the legacy
structural skeleton) + ``match_zwo`` only — it never called the content-aware
``sample_week_workouts``. So mix-emphasis and the over_under hard-floor (F1)
could never follow a weekly recalc, and the plan diverged from first
generation. F6 routes recalc's week construction through ``sample_week_workouts``
the same way generate_plan / regenerate_from_today do.

These tests prove the routing took effect:
  1. The recalc's build-phase mix is content-classified across MANY distinct
     interval shapes (a plan_week-only skeleton produces a far narrower,
     filename-driven set) — i.e. the recalc shape matches first generation.
  2. The over_under hard-floor reaches the recalc (build1+build2 contain
     over_under), which is only possible via the sampler + floor pass.
  3. The endpoint contract is unchanged: recalc still returns the
     (phases, all_weeks, info) 3-tuple with a valid plan.
