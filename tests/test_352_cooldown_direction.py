"""v3.5.2 — cooldowns must descend, in the file itself.

Owner rode vo2max_ladder12_150pct_53min.zwo: the modal drew the cooldown descending (the
renderer force-slopes Cooldown down) but the ZWO authored it ascending
(PowerLow=0.25 → PowerHigh=0.75), and trainer apps that play attributes
chronologically (MyWhoosh / Tacx) ramped him UP to 75% FTP as a "cooldown".
776 files carried the pattern (the v2.4.0 warmup-migration copied the Warmup
low→high shape into cooldowns); the library majority (2,873) was already
authored chronologically descending. All 776 were normalized to the majority
convention: trailing <Cooldown PowerLow=HIGH PowerHigh=LOW>, description
text swapped to match.

This test makes the invariant permanent: a trailing Cooldown may never ramp
up again, so what the chart shows, what the FIT plays, and what a
chronological ZWO player drives are the same ride.
