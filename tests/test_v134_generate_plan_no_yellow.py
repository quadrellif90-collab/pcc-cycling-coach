"""v1.3.4 — generate-plan paints yellow ⚠ on every cell when availability
is heavy enough to push session durations past library coverage.

User report: a freshly-generated 12-week plan painted yellow ⚠ on every
non-rest cell. Tooltip read e.g. "z2 (70min) — sampled from library · 154m"
— description embedded the original library duration but the session
target was 154min after availability rescale.

Three root causes:

1. ``match_zwo`` returned ``zwo_file=""`` when the requested duration
   exceeded library coverage (e.g. 222-min vo2max — library tops at
   150min). ``_classify_card_state`` flags every empty zwo as
   ``missing_workout`` → yellow. Fix: fall back to the longest available
   workout in the right category.
2. The injected mid-cycle ftp_test slot kept ``zwo_file=""`` because
   match_zwo's want_test branch had no candidates (Protocol-category gate
   filtered out every ftp_test-tagged ZWO). Fix: bypass the category gate
   when ``want_test`` is True; tag filter alone is sufficient.
3. ``description`` embedded the original ZWO's duration; after availability
   rescale + re-match, it stayed stale ("z2 (70min) ...") even though
   ``s.duration_min`` was 154. Fix: refresh description after re-match.

The headline test: a 12-week plan with realistic high-volume availability
(weekend 4h, weekday 1-1.5h) must produce <5% yellow cells.
