"""v3.5.4 — continuous plans must schedule anaerobic + neuromuscular work.

Root cause fixed here: `phase_floors` (the only mechanism that GUARANTEES a
workout class appears) was keyed build1/build2/peak and never matched the
single "continuous" phase, so 58% of fresh continuous plans had ZERO
anaerobic AND ZERO neuromuscular despite the owner explicitly wanting sprint /
anaerobic-capacity work. Also pins the companion deload-cleanliness fix
(Finding 6): a stepback week must carry no genuinely-hard session.
