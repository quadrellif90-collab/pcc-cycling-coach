"""v3.6.0 — characterise G7 now that the rider's own RPE actually reaches it.

G7 (3-day mean session-RPE ≥ 7 + a hard session planned → drop one intensity
step, Foster 1998) already existed, but it only ever read ICU's imported
`feel` / `perceived_exertion`. The rating the rider gives in this app is
written under `rpe`, so before v3.6.0 it reached nothing — the "feed RPE back
into the planner" loop was open at one line in `_last_3d_mean_feel`.

These tests pin what that now does, deliberately, rather than leaving it
emergent. Two properties matter and are asserted below:

  * The threshold stays Foster's published ≥7. A single rating carries real
    noise (sRPE test-retest CV 28.1%, Wallace 2014 PMID 24662229), so nothing
    here reacts to a 1-unit move; the only effect of a high rating is LESS
    load, never more. Asymmetric and fail-safe on purpose.
  * A rating never inflates through a scale mix-up. `feel` is a 1-5
    satisfaction rating; a real CR-10 number always wins outright.
