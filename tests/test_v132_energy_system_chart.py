"""v1.3.2 BUG-FIX regression — energy-system breakdown chart on the home
dashboard renders empty.

v1.0.6 introduced the secondary "Energy-system breakdown — beta" <details>
panel containing #energy-system-chart. The render call (energySystemChart())
was wired ONLY into loadFitnessChart(days), which fires on date-range button
clicks. On initial home load, loadHome() paints the primary fitnessChart()
but never invokes the secondary chart, so opening the <details> panel shows
the legend and caption but an empty canvas area.

Fix: call energySystemChart() inline with fitnessChart() inside loadHome()
so the secondary chart is painted on every home view, not just after the
user clicks a date-range button.

This test locks in:
1. The canvas element #energy-system-chart exists in the rendered template.
2. energySystemChart() is invoked from loadHome() AND from loadFitnessChart()
   (so the chart paints both on initial load and on date-range switches).
3. /api/wellness returns the three Banister fitness fields
   (cp_fitness, w_prime_fitness, pmax_fitness) in every record, which the
   chart uses as its data source — even when None (3D model not yet run).
