"""v1.0.6 — `_detect_interval_signature` SteadyState-pair branch reliability.

The steady-pair fallback used to key candidate cycles on the full 4-tuple
(on_power, off_power, on_s, off_s) and return the single most-common pair. Two
failure modes:
  * off-power / off-duration drifting between cycles fragmented one real set
    into several keys -> undercount;
  * a set ending on its final hard effort (no trailing recovery) dropped that
    last rep.
Fix: group candidate on-blocks by the ON SHAPE only -- (on_s, round(on_power,2))
-- sum reps of the dominant shape, and count a matching dangling final work
block. Mirrors the IntervalsT branch.
