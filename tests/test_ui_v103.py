"""v1.0.3 IMPL-UI — minimal smoke tests for the dashboard template
edits made by IMPL-UI-V103.

The dashboard is a static template (rendered on `/`), so the easiest
tests just read templates/dashboard.html and assert on substring
presence. This avoids spinning up the full app fixture for what is
fundamentally a markup-presence check.

Three smoke checks:
  1. Rendered HTML contains all four `planpop-*` IDs (the popover
     blocks for Reforecast / Regenerate / Availability / Rematch).
  2. Rendered HTML contains the `<details class="plan-help-panel">`
     "How your plan updates" panel.
  3. The new `loadMissedSuggestions` JS function name appears in
     the rendered HTML.
