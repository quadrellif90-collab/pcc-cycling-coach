"""v1.3.3 perf regression — dashboard frontpage must paint cards quickly.

Pre-fix the home tab cards (LEG CHECK, READINESS, THIS WEEK, eFTP, BODY &
PERFORMANCE, TODAY'S RECOMMENDATION, RECENT ACTIVITIES, POWER DURATION
CURVE, etc.) were stuck on "Loading…" for 5-10s after a v1.3.2 ship. Two
contributing roots, fixed together:

1. ``loadHome()`` ``await loadTodaySession()`` blocked every card painted
   below it (recent activities, power curve, body perf, readiness
   composite, morning log) until ``/api/today-session`` resolved. With
   that endpoint at ~200-700ms warm and worse cold, the user saw the
   page spin instead of paint.

2. ``/api/calendar`` (also fired on home-load) spent ~250ms in TWO
   uncached ICU HTTP round-trips inside ``_build_summary_block``
   (``_actual_ctl_today`` + ``_hrv_trend_score`` both bypassed the
   ``cached()`` helper). With real ICU latency (300-500ms) this
   compounded to over a second of blocking work per /api/calendar call.

The test locks both:
- ``/api/calendar`` warm response < 250ms (was ~480ms).
- ``loadTodaySession()`` not awaited from ``loadHome()`` so its latency
  cannot block downstream cards.
