"""Block evaluation: "which prescribed blocks did I actually do?"

The rider marks a lap per interval and intervals.icu returns, for every lap,
the offset on the ride clock where it started. Those offsets are the feature:
four earlier versions tried to infer which lap was which block from the shape
of the lap alone, and each shipped a different class of confident wrong verdict
— a session the rider abandoned certified as complete, a block ridden harder
than asked reported as not ridden, a completed block called missing because the
recoveries ran long. Every one of those readings is admissible from shape. None
of them survives knowing WHEN the lap happened.

The last section is the regression that matters: every interval workout in the
library, ridden a dozen ways whose truth is known by construction. A verdict
that disagrees with the truth is a misgrade and fails. No verdict at all is
allowed — the laps do not always settle the question, and saying nothing is the
correct answer when they do not.
