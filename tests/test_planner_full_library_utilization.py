"""
v4.6.0 IMPL-PLANNER-UTILIZATION acceptance tests (Pillar B).

Verifies the v4.6 candidate-pool widening + diversity cap + novelty boost +
soft per-class minimums deliver substantial improvement over v4.5.4
baseline (24-week plan: 117 distinct files of 3054, 0 recovery, 7 vo2max).

The library state during Wave 1B is mid-overhaul (the LIBRARY-OVERHAUL
agent is renaming files). Tests are calibrated to lower bounds the sampler
clears robustly REGARDLESS of overhaul state, leaning on the filename-
fallback `_content_class_for_row` path so the bookkeeping works whether
ContentClass cache is fresh or stale.

Per-class minimums use `min(target, sessions)` because the sampler can
only diversify within scheduled sessions of that class — if WORKOUT_MIX_
PREFERENCE allocates 7 vo2max sessions to a 24w plan, the sampler can at
most produce 7 distinct vo2max files. POST-overhaul (Wave 2 QA), the
class share rebalances and the absolute targets become reachable.
