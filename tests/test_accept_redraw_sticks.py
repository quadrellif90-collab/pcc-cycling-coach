"""An accepted redraw stays accepted.

The rider previews a workout, clicks Accept, and a different workout lands in
the plan. Mechanism, confirmed on a live plan: accept-redraw installed the
candidate without pinning it, then ran a reforecast over the whole plan. The
reforecast applies the availability calendar literally — a 51-min accepted
file on a 60-min day is a 17% change, over the 15% re-match threshold — so it
re-matched the day while EXCLUDING the file just accepted. Deterministic:
any accepted workout whose length differs >=15% from the day's hours got
replaced on the spot.

Two fixes, both pinned here: accept-redraw marks the day user_swapped (the
same pin swap-type and the FTP-test choice already set), and the reforecast
availability reflow leaves pinned days alone — except a day the rider zeroed,
which still becomes rest whatever was pinned.
