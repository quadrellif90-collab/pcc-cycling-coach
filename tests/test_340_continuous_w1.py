"""3.4.0 W1 (IP_CONTINUOUS_MODE amendments A+B) — continuous goal engine.

A — goal_type "continuous" (focus prefs ftp|vo2|both): rolling
    CONTINUOUS_HORIZON_WEEKS horizon, ONE "continuous" phase, 3-load:1-deload
    via the existing stepback cadence, NO taper/consolidation (the 3.3.2
    goal_type taper gate extended to continuous by exclusion).
B — recalc EXTEND path: extend_continuous_plan drops elapsed weeks from the
    horizon and appends week N+4 (kept weeks byte-identical, pinned-seed
    deterministic); the 3.3.1 pool-collapse breaker guards the append; the
    P1 finite-plan engine consumers take plan_weeks=None / continuous
    without crashing (complete no-target readiness shape).

Hermetic: pinned current_ctl + recent_weekly_tss on every engine call, no
network (conftest gates), and the tracked workouts/.library_index.json is
snapshotted + restored around the module (the planner rewrites it on load).
