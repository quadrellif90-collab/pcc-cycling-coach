"""Port selection: zero-config, stable across restarts, overridable.

The rider is never asked to pick a port — being prompted for one on first run
would be a worse experience than the collision it avoids. So the flow has to
hold up unattended:

  * the default must not be a port anything else wants (22400);
  * it must not sit in any OS ephemeral pool, or it fails to bind
    intermittently rather than never (see the band assertions below);
  * a busy port falls back instead of refusing to launch;
  * an ALREADY-RUNNING Domestique is not a collision — falling back there
    would start a second server instead of focusing the open window;
  * whatever bound last time is preferred next time, so bookmarks survive;
  * DOMESTIQUE_PORT overrides everything, with no second-guessing.
